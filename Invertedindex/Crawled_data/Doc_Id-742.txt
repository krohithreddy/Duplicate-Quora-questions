FROM   emp e, dept d
WHERE  e.deptno = d.deptno
AND    e.sal > 1000; Selection Filtering Joining Projection Answer: A, C, D. Projection is including only the required columns in query, while Selection is selecting only the required data.

FROM dual; 12 5+7 5 7 Answer: B.Oracle treats the values within double quotes as string expressions. 6. Write a query to display employee details (Name, Department, Salary and Job) from EMP table. SELECT ename, deptno, sal, job FROM emp; SELECT * FROM emp; SELECT DISTINCT ename, deptno, sal, job FROM emp; SELECT ename, deptno, sal FROM emp; Answer A.Select the required from the tables each separated by a comma. 7. Which of the below queries displays employees' name and new salary after the increment of 1000? SELECT ename, sal FROM emp; SELECT ename, sal=sal+1000 FROM emp; SELECT ename, sal+1000 FROM emp; SELECT ename, 1000 FROM emp; Answer: C. Basic arithmetic calculations can be done using the columns in SELECT statements. 8. Determine the output of the below query SELECT 36/2-5*10 FROM dual; 130 -32 -120 175 Answer: B. Multiplication and Division occur before addition and subtraction. 9. Determine the output of the below query SELECT (100-25)/15*(20-3) FROM dual; 0.294 -85 63.67 85 Answer: D.

NULL is a special value with zero bytes NULL is no value or unknown value NULL is represented by a blank space NULL is not same as zero Answer: B, D.NULL is NO VALUE but neither same as zero nor as blank or space character. 11.

A column alias renames a column heading A column alias is an alternate column in a table A column alias can be specified during table definition A column alias immediately follows the column or expression in the SELECT statement Answer: A, D. Column Alias can be used to name an expression in the SELECT statement. 13. Specify the column alias NEWSAL for the expression containing salary in the below SQL query SELECT ename, job, sal + 100 FROM emp; (sal + 100) AS NEWSAL (sal + 100) NEWSAL (sal + 100) IS NEWSAL sal + 100 IS NEWSAL Answer: A, B.Use 'AS' to signify new alias to a column expression. 14. Specify the column alias "New Salary" for the expression containing salary in the below SQL query SELECT ename, job, sal + 100 FROM emp; (sal + 100) AS New Salary (sal + 100) "New Salary" (sal + 100) IS New Salary sal + 100 as "New Salary" Answer: B, D. Column alias with space and special characters must be enquoted within double quotes. 15. Which command is used to display the structure of a table?

DESC emp Raises error "SP2-0042: unknown command "desc emp" - rest of line ignored." Lists the columns of EMP table Lists the EMP table columns, their data type and nullity Lists the columns of EMP table along with their data types Answer: C. DESCRIBE is used to show the table structure along with table columns, their data type and nullity 17. Which of the below statements are true about the DESCRIBE command? It can be used in SQL*Plus only It can be used in both SQL*Plus as well as SQL Developer It doesn't works for object tables It doesn't works for SYS owned tables Answer: B. 18.

Concatenation operator joins two values as an expression. 20. Predict the output of the below query SELECT ename || NULL
FROM emp
WHERE empno = 7369 SMITH SMITH NULL SMITHNULL ORA-00904: "NULL": invalid identifier Answer: A. Concatenation with NULL results into same value. 21. Predict the output of the below query SELECT 50 || 0001
FROM dual 500001 51 501 5001 Answer: C. The leading zeroes in the right operand of expression are ignored by Oracle. 22. You execute the below query SELECT e.ename||' departments's name is:'|| d.dname
FROM emp e, dept d
where e.deptno=d.deptno; And get the exception - ORA-01756: quoted string not properly terminated. Which of the following solutions can permanently resolve the problem? Use double quote marks for the literal character string Use [q] operator to enquote the literal character string and selecting the delimiter of choice Remove the single quote mark (apostrophe) from the literal character string Use another delimiter to bypass the single quote apostrophe in the literal string Answer: B. The [q] operator is used to enquote character literals with a quote. 23. Which of the below SELECT statement shows the correct usage of [q] operator?

   FROM emp e, dept d
   WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno; SELECT e.ename || q['department's name is']|| d.dname
   FROM emp e, dept d
   WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno; SELECT e.ename || q[department's name is]|| d.dname
   FROM emp e, dept d
   WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno; SELECT e.ename || q'(department's name is)'|| d.dname
