As like RDBMS, OrientDB also supports restoring operation. Only from the console mode, you can execute this operation successfully. The following statement is the basic syntax for restoring operation. 
orientdb> RESTORE DATABSE <url of the backup zip file>
 Example You have to perform this operation only from the console mode. Therefore, first you have to start the OrientDB console using the following OrientDB command. 
$ orientdb
 Then, connect to the respective database to restore the backup. You can use the following command to connect to the database named demo. 
orientdb> CONNECT PLOCAL:/opt/orientdb/databases/demo admin admin
 After successful connection, you can use the following command to restore the backup from ‘backup-demo.zip’ file. Before executing, make sure the backup-demo.zip file is placed in the current directory. 
Orientdb {db = demo}> RESTORE DATABASE backup-demo.zip
 If this command is executed successfully, you will get some success notifications along with the following message. 
Database restored in 0.26 seconds
