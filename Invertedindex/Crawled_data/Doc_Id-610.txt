Redis HyperLogLog is an algorithm that uses randomization in order to provide an approximation of the number of unique elements in a set using just a constant, and small amount of memory. HyperLogLog provides a very good approximation of the cardinality of a set even using a very small amount of memory around 12 kbytes per key with a standard error of 0.81%. There is no limit to the number of items you can count, unless you approach 264 items. Example Following example explains how Redis HyperLogLog works.

 Redis HyperLogLog Commands Following table lists some basic commands related to Redis HyperLogLog. S.No Command & Description 1 PFADD key element [element ...] Adds the specified elements to the specified HyperLogLog. 2 PFCOUNT key [key ...] Returns the approximated cardinality of the set(s) observed by the HyperLogLog at key(s). 3 PFMERGE destkey sourcekey [sourcekey ...] Merges N different HyperLogLogs into a single one.
