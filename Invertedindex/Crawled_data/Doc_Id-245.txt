Any relational database has a typical schema design that shows number of tables and the relationship between these tables. While in MongoDB, there is no concept of relationship. Advantages of MongoDB over RDBMS Schema less − MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents. Number of fields, content and size of the document can differ from one document to another. Structure of a single object is clear. No complex joins. Deep query-ability. MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query language that's nearly as powerful as SQL. Tuning. Ease of scale-out − MongoDB is easy to scale. Conversion/mapping of application objects to database objects not needed. Uses internal memory for storing the (windowed) working set, enabling faster access of data. Why Use MongoDB? Document Oriented Storage − Data is stored in the form of JSON style documents. Index on any attribute Replication and high availability Auto-sharding Rich queries Fast in-place updates Professional support by MongoDB Where to Use MongoDB?
