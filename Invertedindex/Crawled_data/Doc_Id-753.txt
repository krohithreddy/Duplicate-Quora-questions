SQLite AND & OR operators are used to compile multiple conditions to narrow down the selected data in an SQLite statement. These two operators are called conjunctive operators. These operators provide a means to make multiple comparisons with different operators in the same SQLite statement. The AND Operator The AND operator allows the existence of multiple conditions in a SQLite statement's WHERE clause. While using AND operator, complete condition will be assumed true when all the conditions are true. For example, [condition1] AND [condition2] will be true only when both condition1 and condition2 are true. Syntax Following is the basic syntax of AND operator with WHERE clause. 
SELECT column1, column2, columnN 
FROM table_name
WHERE [condition1] AND [condition2]...AND [conditionN];
 You can combine N number of conditions using AND operator. For an action to be taken by the SQLite statement, whether it be a transaction or query, all conditions separated by the AND must be TRUE. Example Consider COMPANY table with the following records âˆ’ 
ID          NAME        AGE         ADDRESS     SALARY
----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
1           Paul        32          California  20000.0
2           Allen       25          Texas       15000.0
3           Teddy       23          Norway      20000.0
4           Mark        25          Rich-Mond   65000.0
5           David       27          Texas       85000.0
6           Kim         22          South-Hall  45000.0
7           James       24          Houston     10000.0
 Following SELECT statement lists down all the records where AGE is greater than or equal to 25 AND salary is greater than or equal to 65000.00. 
sqlite> SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE AGE >= 25 AND SALARY >= 65000;

ID          NAME        AGE         ADDRESS     SALARY
----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
4           Mark        25          Rich-Mond   65000.0
5           David       27          Texas       85000.0
 The OR Operator The OR operator is also used to combine multiple conditions in a SQLite statement's WHERE clause. While using OR operator, complete condition will be assumed true when at least any of the conditions is true. For example, [condition1] OR [condition2] will be true if either condition1 or condition2 is true. Syntax Following is the basic syntax of OR operator with WHERE clause. 
SELECT column1, column2, columnN 
FROM table_name
WHERE [condition1] OR [condition2]...OR [conditionN]
 You can combine N number of conditions using OR operator. For an action to be taken by the SQLite statement, whether it be a transaction or query, only any ONE of the conditions separated by the OR must be TRUE. Example Consider COMPANY table with the following records. 
ID          NAME        AGE         ADDRESS     SALARY
----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
1           Paul        32          California  20000.0
2           Allen       25          Texas       15000.0
3           Teddy       23          Norway      20000.0
4           Mark        25          Rich-Mond   65000.0
5           David       27          Texas       85000.0
6           Kim         22          South-Hall  45000.0
7           James       24          Houston     10000.0
 Following SELECT statement lists down all the records where AGE is greater than or equal to 25 OR salary is greater than or equal to 65000.00. 
sqlite> SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE AGE >= 25 OR SALARY >= 65000;

ID          NAME        AGE         ADDRESS     SALARY
----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
1           Paul        32          California  20000.0
2           Allen       25          Texas       15000.0
4           Mark        25          Rich-Mond   65000.0
