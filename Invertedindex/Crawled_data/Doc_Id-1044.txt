Attribute represents the attribute of an XML element. XSD defines it as a simple type. Syntax 
<xs:attribute name = "attribute-name" type = "attribute-type"/>
 attribute-name Name of the Attribute. For example, 
<xs:attribute name = "rollno" type = "xs:integer"/> 
 defines following rollno attribute which can be used in an XML element. For example 
<student rollno = "393" />
 attribute-type Type of the Attribute. For example, 
<xs:attribute name = "rollno" type = "xs:integer"/> 
 defines type of attribute as integer, rollno should have value of type int. 
<student rollno = "393" />
 Example Consider the following XML Element 
<student rollno = "393" />
 XSD declarations for rollno attribute will be as follows âˆ’ 
<xs:attribute name = "rollno" type = "xs:integer"/>
 Default Value Attribute can have a default value assigned to it. Default value is used in case the attribute has no value. 
<xs:attribute name = "grade" type = "xs:string" default = "NA" /> 
 Fixed Value Attribute can have a fix value assigned. In case a fixed value is assigned, then the element can not have any value. 
<xs:attribute name = "class" type = "xs:string" fixed = "1" /> 
 Restriction Attributes are by default optional. But to make an attribute mandatory, "use" attribute can be used. 
<xs:attribute name = "rollno" type = "xs:integer" use = "required"/>
