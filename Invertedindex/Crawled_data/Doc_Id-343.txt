Drop Database using mysqladmin You would need special privileges to create or to delete a MySQLi database. So assuming you have access to root user, you can create any database using mysql mysqladmin binary. Be careful while deleting any database because you will lose your all the data available in your database. Here is an example to delete a database created in previous chapter − 
[root@host]# mysqladmin -u root -p drop TUTORIALS
Enter password:******
 This will give you a warning and it will confirm if you really want to delete this database or not. 
Dropping the database is potentially a very bad thing to do.
Any data stored in the database will be destroyed.

   <head>
      <title>Connecting MySQLi Server>/title>
   </head>
   
   <body>
      <?php
         $dbhost = 'localhost:3306';
         $dbuser = 'root';
         $dbpass = '<Password Here>';
         $conn = mysqli_connect($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass);
         
         if(! $conn ){
            echo 'Connected failure<br>';
         }
         echo 'Connected successfully<br>';
         $sql = "DROP DATABASE TUTORIALS";
         
         if (mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {
         echo "Record deleted successfully";
         } else {
            echo "Error deleting record: " . mysqli_error($conn);
         }
         mysqli_close($conn);
      ?>
