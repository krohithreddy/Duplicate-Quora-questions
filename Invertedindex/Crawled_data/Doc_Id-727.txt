The ROUND function will round off the value 144.23 according to the specified precision -1 and returns 140. Examine the structure of the EMPLOYEES table as given and answer the questions 2 and 3 that follow. SQL> DESC employees
 Name			 Null?	  Type
 ----------------------- -------- ----------------
 EMPLOYEE_ID		 NOT NULL NUMBER(6)
 FIRST_NAME			  VARCHAR2(20)
 LAST_NAME		 NOT NULL VARCHAR2(25)
 EMAIL			 NOT NULL VARCHAR2(25)
 PHONE_NUMBER			  VARCHAR2(20)
 HIRE_DATE		 NOT NULL DATE
 JOB_ID 		 NOT NULL VARCHAR2(10)
 SALARY 			  NUMBER(8,2)
 COMMISSION_PCT 		  NUMBER(2,2)
 MANAGER_ID			  NUMBER(6)
 DEPARTMENT_ID			  NUMBER(4) 2. You are currently located in New Jersey and have connected to a remote database in San Diego. You issue the following command. SELECT ROUND (sysdate-hire_date,0) FROM employees WHERE (sysdate-hire_date)/180 = 2; What is the outcome of this query? An error because the ROUND function cannot be used with Date arguments. An error because the WHERE condition expression is invalid. Number of days since the employee was hired based on the current San Diego date and time. Number of days since the employee was hired based on the current New Jersey date and time. Answer: C. The SYSDATE function will take the current time of the database which it is connecting to remotely. You must perform basic arithmetic operation to adjust the time zone. 3. You need to display the names of the employees who have the letter 's' in their first name and the letter 't' at the second position in their last name. Which query would give the required output? SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE INSTR(first_name,'s') <> 0 AND SUBSTR(last_name,2,1) = 't'; SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE INSTR(first_name,'s') <> '' AND SUBSTR(last_name,2,1) = 't'; SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE INSTR(first_name,'e') IS NOT NULL AND SUBSTR(last_name,2,1) = 't'; SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE INSTR(first_name,'e') <> 0 AND SUBSTR(last_name,LENGTH(first_name),1) =  
't'; Answer: A. The INSTR function returns the position of a given character in the required string. The SUBSTR function returns set of characters from the string from a given starting and end position. 4. Which of the following statements is true regarding the COUNT function? COUNT (*) counts duplicate values and NULL values in columns of any data type. COUNT function cannot work with DATE datatypes. COUNT (DISTINCT job_id) returns the number of rows excluding rows containing duplicates and NULL values in the job_id column. A SELECT statement using the COUNT function with a DISTINCT keyword cannot have a WHERE clause. Answer: A. The COUNT(*) function returns the number of rows in a table that satisfy the criteria of the SELECT statement, including duplicate rows and rows containing null values in any of the columns. If a WHERE clause is included in the SELECT statement, COUNT(*) returns the number of rows that satisfy the condition in the WHERE clause. In contrast, COUNT(expr) returns the number of non-null values that are in the column identified by expr. COUNT(DISTINCT expr) returns the number of unique, non-null values that are in the column identified by expr. 5. Which of the following commands is used to count the number of rows and non-NULL values in Oracle database? NOT NULL INSTR SUBSTR COUNT Answer: D. The COUNT (ALL column_name) is used to count number of rows excluding NULLs. Similarly, COUNT(*) is used to count the column values including NULLs. 6. What will be the outcome of the query given below? SELECT 100+NULL+999 FROM dual; 100 999 NULL 1099 Answer: C. Any arithmetic operation with NULL results in a NULL. 7. Which of the following statements are true regarding the single row functions? They accept only a single argument. They can be nested only to two levels. Arguments can only be column values or constants. They can return a data type value different from the one that is referenced. Answer: D. Single row functions can take more than one argument and the return type can be different from the data type of the inputs. 8. Which of the below queries will format a value 1680 as $16,80.00? SELECT TO_CHAR(1680.00,'$99G99D99') FROM dual; SELECT TO_CHAR(1680.00,'$9,999V99') FROM dual; SELECT TO_CHAR(1680.00,'$9,999D99') FROM dual; SELECT TO_CHAR(1680.00,'$99G999D99') FROM dual; Answer: A, D. The format model $99G999D99 formats given number into numeric, group separator, and decimals. Other format elements can be leading zeroes, decimal position, comma position, local currency, scientific notation, and sign. 9. Determine the output of the below query. SELECT RPAD(ROUND('78945.45'),10,'*') FROM dual; 78945***** **78945.45 The function RPAD cannot be nested with other functions 78945.45**** Answer: A. The LPAD(string, num, char) and RPAD(string, num, char) functions add a character to the left or right of a given string until it reaches the specified length (num) after padding. The ROUND function rounds the value 78945.45 to 78945 and then pads it with '*' until length of 10 is reached. 10. Which of the following commands allows you to substitute a value whenever a NULL or non-NULL value is encountered in an SQL query? NVL NVLIF NVL2 LNNVL Answer: C. The NVL2 function takes minimum three arguments. The NVL2 function checks the first expression. If it is not null, the NVL2 function returns the second argument. If the first argument is null, the third argument is returned. 11. Which of the following type of single-row functions cannot be incorporated in Oracle DB? Character Numeric Conversion None of the above Answer: D. The types of single-row functions like character, numeric, date, conversion and miscellaneous as well as programmer-written can be incorporated in Oracle DB. 12. Out of the below clauses, where can the single-row functions be used? SELECT WHERE ORDER BY All of the above Answer: D. Single row function can be used in SELECT statement, WHERE clause and ORDER BY clause. 13. What is true regarding the NVL function in Oracle DB? The syntax of NVL is NVL (exp1, exp2) where exp1 and exp2 are expressions. NVL (exp1, exp2) will return the value of exp2 if the expression exp1 is NULL. NVL (exp1, exp2) will return the value of the expression exp2 if exp1 is NOT NULL. NVL (exp1, exp2) will return exp1 if the expression exp2 is NULL. Answer: B. NVL function replaces a null value with an alternate value. Columns of data type date, character, and number can use NVL to provide alternate values. Data types of the column and its alternative must match. 14. Examine the structure of the EMPLOYEES table as given. SQL> DESC employees
 Name			 Null?	  Type
 ----------------------- -------- ----------------
 EMPLOYEE_ID		 NOT NULL NUMBER(6)
 FIRST_NAME			  VARCHAR2(20)
 LAST_NAME		 NOT NULL VARCHAR2(25)

 JOB_ID 		 NOT NULL VARCHAR2(10)
 SALARY 			  NUMBER(8,2)
 COMMISSION_PCT 		  NUMBER(2,2)
 MANAGER_ID			  NUMBER(6)
 DEPARTMENT_ID			  NUMBER(4) What will be the outcome of the following query? SELECT last_name, NVL(job_id, 'Unknown') 
FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE 'A%'
ORDER BY last_name; It will throw an ORA error on execution. It will list the job IDs for all employees from EMPLOYEES table. It will list the job IDs of all employees and substitute NULL job IDs with a literal 'Unknown'. It will display the last names for all the employees and their job IDs including the NULL values in the job ID. Answer: C. The NVL function replaces a null value with an alternate value. Columns of data type date, character, and number can use NVL to provide alternate values. Data types of the column and its alternative must match. 15. What will the outcome of the following query? SELECT NVL (NULL,'1') FROM dual; NULL 1 0 Gives an error because NULL cannot be explicitly specified to NVL function Answer: B. The NVL will treat NULL as a value and returns the alternate argument i.e. 1 as the result. 16. What will be the outcome of the following query? (Consider the structure of the EMPLOYEES table as given) SQL> DESC employees
 Name			 Null?	  Type
 ----------------------- -------- ----------------
 EMPLOYEE_ID		 NOT NULL NUMBER(6)
 FIRST_NAME			  VARCHAR2(20)
 LAST_NAME		 NOT NULL VARCHAR2(25)
 EMAIL			 NOT NULL VARCHAR2(25)
 PHONE_NUMBER			  VARCHAR2(20)
 HIRE_DATE		 NOT NULL DATE
 JOB_ID 		 NOT NULL VARCHAR2(10)
 SALARY 			  NUMBER(8,2)
 COMMISSION_PCT 		  NUMBER(2,2)
 MANAGER_ID			  NUMBER(6)
 DEPARTMENT_ID			  NUMBER(4) SELECT employee_id , NVL(salary, 0) FROM employees WHERE first_name like 'P%' ORDER BY first_name; It will display 0 in the salary column for all the employees whose first name starts with a 'P' It will display the salaries for the employees whose name start with a 'P' and 0 if the salaries are NULL. It will throw an ORA error as the ORDER BY clause should also contain the salary column. The NVL function should be correctly used as NVL (0, salary) Answer: B. NVL function replaces a null value with an alternate value. Columns of data type date, character, and number can use NVL to provide alternate values. Data types of the column and its alternative must match. 17. Which of the following statements is true regarding the NVL statement? SELECT NVL (arg1, arg2) FROM dual; The two expressions arg1 and arg2 should only be in VARCHAR2 or NUMBER data type format. The arguments arg1 and arg2 should have the same data type If arg1 is VARCHAR2, then Oracle DB converts arg2 to the datatype of arg1 before comparing them and returns VARCHAR2 in the character set of arg1. An NVL function cannot be used with arguments of DATE datatype. Answer: C. If arg1 is of VARCHAR2 data type, Oracle does implicit type conversion for arg2 id arg2 is of NUMBER datatype. In all other cases, both the arguments must be of same datatype. 18. What will be the outcome of the following query? (Consider the structure of the EMPLOYEES table as given) SQL> DESC employees
 Name			 Null?	  Type
 ----------------------- -------- ----------------
 EMPLOYEE_ID		 NOT NULL NUMBER(6)
 FIRST_NAME			  VARCHAR2(20)
 LAST_NAME		 NOT NULL VARCHAR2(25)
 EMAIL			 NOT NULL VARCHAR2(25)
 PHONE_NUMBER			  VARCHAR2(20)
 HIRE_DATE		 NOT NULL DATE
 JOB_ID 		 NOT NULL VARCHAR2(10)
 SALARY 			  NUMBER(8,2)
 COMMISSION_PCT 		  NUMBER(2,2)
 MANAGER_ID			  NUMBER(6)
 DEPARTMENT_ID			  NUMBER(4) SELECT NVL2(job_id,'Regular Employee','New Joinee') FROM employees; It will return the value 'Regular Employee' for all the employees who have NULL job IDs It will return the value 'New Joinee' for all the employees who have NULL job IDs It will return 'Regular Employee' if the job ID is NULL It will throw an ORA error on execution. Answer: B. The NVL2 function examines the first expression. If the first expression is not null, the NVL2 function returns the second expression. If the first expression is null, the third expression is returned. 19. Which of the following is true for the statement given as under. NVL2 (arg1, arg2, arg3) Arg2 and Arg3 can have any data type Arg1 cannot have the LONG data type Oracle will convert the data type of expr2 according to Arg1 If Arg2 is a NUMBER, then Oracle determines the numeric precedence, implicitly converts the other argument to that datatype, and returns that datatype. Answer: D. The data types of the arg2 and arg3 parameters must be compatible, and they cannot be of type LONG. They must either be of the same type, or it must be possible to convert arg3 to the type of the arg2 parameter. The data type returned by the NVL2 function is the same as that of the arg2 parameter. 20. Examine the structure of the EMPLOYEES table as given. SQL> DESC employees
 Name			 Null?	  Type
 ----------------------- -------- ----------------
 EMPLOYEE_ID		 NOT NULL NUMBER(6)
 FIRST_NAME			  VARCHAR2(20)
 LAST_NAME		 NOT NULL VARCHAR2(25)
 EMAIL			 NOT NULL VARCHAR2(25)
 PHONE_NUMBER			  VARCHAR2(20)
 HIRE_DATE		 NOT NULL DATE
 JOB_ID 		 NOT NULL VARCHAR2(10)
 SALARY 			  NUMBER(8,2)
 COMMISSION_PCT 		  NUMBER(2,2)
 MANAGER_ID			  NUMBER(6)
 DEPARTMENT_ID			  NUMBER(4) What will be the outcome of the query mentioned below? SeLECT first_name, salary, NVL2(commission_pct,  salary + (salary * commission_pct), salary) "Income" 
FROM employees 
WHERE first_name like 'P%'  
ORDER BY first_name; Salary will be returned if the Commission for the employee is NOT NULL. Commission_pct will be returned if the Commission for the employee is NOT NULL. Employees with the first name starting with 'P' and salary+(salary*commission_pct) will be returned if the employee earns a commission. The query throws an error because a mathematical expression is written inside NVL2. Answer: C. The NVL2 function examines the first expression. If the first expression is not null, the NVL2 function returns the second expression. If the first expression is null, the third expression is returned. 21. What is true about the NULLIF function in Oracle DB? NULLIF(expr1,expr2) will return expr2 if the two expressions are NOT NULL. NULLIF(expr1,expr2) will return 0 if the two expressions are NULL. NULLIF(expr1,expr2) will return NULL if the two expressions are equal. Expr1 can be NULL in NULLIF(expr1, expr2) Answer: C. The NULLIF function tests two terms for equality. If they are equal the function returns a null, else it returns the first of the two terms tested. The NULLIF function takes two mandatory parameters of any data type. The syntax is NULLIF(arg1,arg2), where the arguments arg1 and arg2 are compared. If they are identical, then NULL is returned. If they differ, the arg1 is returned. 22. Pick the correct answer given after the statement shown as under. NULLIF (arg1,arg2) Arg1 and Arg2 can be of different data types. Arg1 and Arg2 have to be equal in order to be used in the NULLIF function. There is no internal conversion of data types if NULLIF used as in the case of NVL and NVL2. This is equivalent to CASE WHEN Arg1 = Arg22 THEN NULL ELSE Arg1 END. Answer: D. 23. Examine the structure of the EMPLOYEES table as given. SQL> DESC employees

The character function INSTR accepts a string value but returns numeric position of a character in the string. 34. What is true about Number functions? They return both Character as well as Number values They can't accept expressions as input Number functions can't be nested. They accept Number arguments and return Number values only. Answer: D. 35. Which of the following is an exception to the return value of a DATE type single-row function? TO_DATE SYSDATE MONTHS_BETWEEN TO_NUMBER Answer: C. All the DATE data type functions return DATE as return values except MONTHS_BETWEEN which returns a number. 36. Which of the following is not a Conversion type Single Row function? TO_CHAR TO_DATE NVL TO_NUMBER Answer: C. Conversion functions convert a value from one data type to another. The NVL function replaces a null value with an alternate value. 37. Which of the following is a Case-Conversion Character function? CONCAT SUBSTR INITCAP REPLACE Answer: C.

The CONCAT function joins two strings without any space in between. 41. What will be the outcome of the following query? SELECT 'The job id for '||upper(last_name) ||' is a '||lower(job_id) FROM employees; The job id for ABEL is a sa_rep The job id forABEL is a sa_rep The job id for abel is SA_REP The job id for abel is sa_rep Answer: A. 42. Assuming the last names of the employees are in a proper case in the table employees, what will be the outcome of the following query? SELECT employee_id, last_name, department_id  FROM employees WHERE last_name = 'smith'; It will display the details of the employee with the last name as Smith It will give no result. It will give the details for the employee having the last name as 'Smith' in all Lower case. It will give the details for the employee having the last name as 'Smith' in all INITCAP case. Answer: B. Provided the last names in the employees table are in a proper case, the condition WHERE last_name = 'smith' will not be satistified and hence no results will be displayed. 43. What is true about the CONCAT function in Oracle DB? It can have only characters as input. It can have only 2 input parameters. It can have 2 or more input parameters It joins values by putting a white space in between the concatenated strings by default. Answer: B. The CONCAT function accepts only two arguments of NUMBER or VARCHAR2 datatypes. 44. What is true about the SUBSTR function in Oracle DB? It extracts a string of determined length It shows the length of a string as a numeric value It finds the numeric position of a named character It trims characters from one (or both) sides from a character string Answer: A. The SUBSTR(string, x, y) function accepts three parameters and returns a string consisting of the number of characters extracted from the source string, beginning at the specified start position (x). When position is positive, then the function counts from the beginning of string to find the first character. When position is negative, then the function counts backward from the end of string. 45. What will be the outcome of the following query? SELECT length('hi') FROM dual; 2 3 1 hi Answer: A. the LENGTH function simply gives the length of the string. 46. What is the difference between LENGTH and INSTR functions in Oracle DB? They give the same results when operated on a string. LENGTH gives the position of a particular character in a string INSTR gives the position of a particular character in a string while LENGTH gives the length of the string. LENGTH and INSTR can be used interchangeably. Answer: C. 47. Examine the structure of the EMPLOYEES table as given. SQL> DESC employees
