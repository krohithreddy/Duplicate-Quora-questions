Redis Lists are simply lists of strings, sorted by insertion order. You can add elements in Redis lists in the head or the tail of the list. Maximum length of a list is 232 - 1 elements (4294967295, more than 4 billion of elements per list). Example 
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> LPUSH tutorials redis 
(integer) 1 
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> LPUSH tutorials mongodb 
(integer) 2 
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> LPUSH tutorials mysql 
(integer) 3 
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> LRANGE tutorials 0 10  
1) "mysql" 
2) "mongodb" 
3) "redis"
 In the above example, three values are inserted in Redis list named ‘tutorials’ by the command LPUSH. Redis Lists Commands Following table lists some basic commands related to lists. S.No Command & Description 1 BLPOP key1 [key2 ] timeout Removes and gets the first element in a list, or blocks until one is available 2 BRPOP key1 [key2 ] timeout Removes and gets the last element in a list, or blocks until one is available 3 BRPOPLPUSH source destination timeout Pops a value from a list, pushes it to another list and returns it; or blocks until one is available 4 LINDEX key index Gets an element from a list by its index 5 LINSERT key BEFORE|AFTER pivot value Inserts an element before or after another element in a list 6 LLEN key Gets the length of a list 7 LPOP key Removes and gets the first element in a list 8 LPUSH key value1 [value2] Prepends one or multiple values to a list 9 LPUSHX key value Prepends a value to a list, only if the list exists 10 LRANGE key start stop Gets a range of elements from a list 11 LREM key count value Removes elements from a list 12 LSET key index value Sets the value of an element in a list by its index 13 LTRIM key start stop Trims a list to the specified range 14 RPOP key Removes and gets the last element in a list 15 RPOPLPUSH source destination Removes the last element in a list, appends it to another list and returns it 16 RPUSH key value1 [value2] Appends one or multiple values to a list 17 RPUSHX key value Appends a value to a list, only if the list exists
