In the installation chapter, we discussed how to connect the database manually. In this chapter, we will discuss how to connect the database programmatically (using Java programming). Take a look at the following program, which will start the server and create a connection between the Java application and the database. Example 
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;

public class ConnectDatabase {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Connection con = null;
      
      try {
         //Registering the HSQLDB JDBC driver
         Class.forName("org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver");
         //Creating the connection with HSQLDB
         con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/testdb", "SA", "");
         if (con!= null){
            System.out.println("Connection created successfully");
            
         }else{
            System.out.println("Problem with creating connection");
         }
      
      }  catch (Exception e) {
         e.printStackTrace(System.out);
      }
   }
}
 Save this code into ConnectDatabase.java file. You will have to start the database using the following command. 
\>cd C:\hsqldb-2.3.4\hsqldb
hsqldb>java -classpath lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.server.Server --database.0
file:hsqldb/demodb --dbname.0 testdb
 You can use the following command to compile and execute the code. 
\>javac ConnectDatabase.java
\>java ConnectDatabase
 After execution of the above command, you will receive the following output âˆ’ 
Connection created successfully
