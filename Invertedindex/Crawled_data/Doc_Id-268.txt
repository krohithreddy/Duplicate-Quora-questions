We have been using MongoDB Object Id in all the previous chapters. In this chapter, we will understand the structure of ObjectId. An ObjectId is a 12-byte BSON type having the following structure − The first 4 bytes representing the seconds since the unix epoch The next 3 bytes are the machine identifier The next 2 bytes consists of process id The last 3 bytes are a random counter value MongoDB uses ObjectIds as the default value of _id field of each document, which is generated while the creation of any document. The complex combination of ObjectId makes all the _id fields unique. Creating New ObjectId To generate a new ObjectId use the following code − 
>newObjectId = ObjectId()
 The above statement returned the following uniquely generated id − 
ObjectId("5349b4ddd2781d08c09890f3")
 Instead of MongoDB generating the ObjectId, you can also provide a 12-byte id − 
>myObjectId = ObjectId("5349b4ddd2781d08c09890f4")
 Creating Timestamp of a Document Since the _id ObjectId by default stores the 4-byte timestamp, in most cases you do not need to store the creation time of any document. You can fetch the creation time of a document using getTimestamp method − 
>ObjectId("5349b4ddd2781d08c09890f4").getTimestamp()
 This will return the creation time of this document in ISO date format − 
ISODate("2014-04-12T21:49:17Z")
 Converting ObjectId to String In some cases, you may need the value of ObjectId in a string format. To convert the ObjectId in string, use the following code − 
>newObjectId.str
 The above code will return the string format of the Guid − 
5349b4ddd2781d08c09890f3
