OrientDB supports several data types natively. Following is the complete table on the same. Sr. No. Type Description 1 Boolean Handles only the values True or False. Java types: java.lang.Boolean Min: 0 Max: 1 2 Integer 32-bit signed integers. Java types: java.lang.Interger Min: -2,147,483,648 Max: +2,147,483,647 3 Short Small 16-bit signed integers. Java types: java.lang.short Min: -32,768 Max: 32,767 4 Long Big 64-bit signed integers. Java types: java.lang.Long Min: -263 Max: +263-1 5 Float Decimal numbers. Java types: java.lang.Float Min: 2-149 Max: (2-2-23)*2,127 6 Double Decimal numbers with high precision. Java types: Java.lang.Double. Min: 2-1074 Max: (2-2-52)*21023 7 Date-time Any date with the precision up to milliseconds. Java types: java.util.Date 8 String Any string as alphanumeric sequence of chars. Java types: java.lang.String 9 Binary Can contain any value as byte array. Java types: byte[ ] Min: 0 Max: 2,147,483,647 10 Embedded The record is contained inside the owner. The contained record has no RecordId. Java types: ORecord 11 Embedded list The records are contained inside the owner. The contained records have no RecordIds and are reachable only by navigating the owner record. Java types: List<objects> Min: 0 Max: 41,000,000 items 12 Embedded set The records are contained inside the owner. The contained records have no RecordId and are reachable only by navigating the owner record. Java types: set<objects> Min: 0 Max: 41,000,000 items 13 Embedded map The records are contained inside the owner as values of the entries, while the keys can only be strings. The contained records have no RecordId and are reachable only by navigating the owner Record. Java types: Map<String, ORecord> Min: 0 Max: 41,000,000 items 14 Link Link to another Record. It's a common one-to-one relationship Java Types: ORID, <? extends ORecord> Min: 1 Max: 32767:2^63-1 15 Link list Links to other Records. It's a common one-to-many relationship where only the RecordIds are stored. Java types: List<? Extends ORecord> Min: 0 Max: 41,000,000 items 16 Link set Links to other records. It's a common one-to-many relationship. Java types: Set<? extends ORecord> Min: 0 Max: 41,000,000 items 17 Link map Links to other records as value of the entries, while keys can only be strings. It's a common one-to-many relationship. Only the RecordIds are stored. Java types: Map<String, ? extends Record> Min: 0 Max: 41,000,000 items 18 Byte Single byte. Useful to store small 8-bit signed integers. Java types: java.lang.Byte Min: -128 Max: +127 19 Transient Any value not stored on database. 20 Date Any date as year, month and day. Java Types: java.util.Date 21 Custom Used to store a custom type providing the Marshall and Unmarshall methods. Java types: OSerializableStream Min: 0 Max: x 22 Decimal Decimal numbers without rounding. Java types: java.math.BigDecimal 23 LinkBag List of RecordIds as specific RidBag. Java types: ORidBag 24 Any Not determinate type, used to specify collections of mixed type, and null. In the following chapters, how to use these data types in OrientDB is discussed.
