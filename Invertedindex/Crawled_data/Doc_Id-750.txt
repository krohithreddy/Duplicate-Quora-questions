1.Which SET operator does the following figure indicate? UNION UNION ALL INTERSECT MINUS Answer: A. Set operators are used to combine the results of two (or more) SELECT statements.Valid set operators in Oracle 11g are UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, and MINUS. When used with two SELECT statements, the UNION set operator returns the results of both queries.However,if there are any duplicates, they are removed, and the duplicated record is listed only once.To include duplicates in the results,use the UNION ALL set operator.INTERSECT lists only records that are returned by both queries; the MINUS set operator removes the second query's results from the output if they are also found in the first query's results. INTERSECT and MINUS set operations produce unduplicated results. 2.Which SET operator does the following figure indicate? UNION UNION ALL INTERSECT MINUS Answer: B. UNION ALL Returns the combined rows from two queries without sorting or removing duplicates. sql_certificate 3.Which SET operator does the following figure indicate? UNION UNION ALL INTERSECT MINUS Answer: C. INTERSECT Returns only the rows that occur in both queries' result sets, sorting them and removing duplicates. 4.Which SET operator does the following figure indicate? UNION UNION ALL INTERSECT MINUS Answer: D. MINUS Returns only the rows in the first result set that do not appear in the second result set, sorting them and removing duplicates. 5.What is true about SET operators? They change values of rows They combine the results of only two component queries into one result They combine the results of 10 component queries into two result sets. They combine the results of two or more component queries into one result Answer: D. Set operators are used to combine the results of two (or more) SELECT statements. Valid set operators in Oracle 11g are UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, and MINUS. 6.What are the queries containing SET operators called? Sub-queries Co-related sub-queries GROUP BY queries Compound queries Answer: D. 7.What is true about the UNION operator? It returns rows from the combined queries along with NULL values It returns rows for the combined queries after eliminating duplicates It returns rows for the combined queries along with duplicate values It returns rows for the combined queries ignoring the NULL values Answer: B. UNION Returns the combined rows from two queries, sorting them and removing duplicates. 8.What is true about the UNION ALL operator? It returns rows from the combined queries along with NULL values It returns rows for the combined queries after eliminating duplicates It returns rows for the combined queries along with duplicate values It returns rows for the combined queries ignoring the NULL values Answer: C. UNION ALL Returns the combined rows from two queries without sorting or removing duplicates. 9.What is true about the INTERSECT operator? It returns rows from the combined queries along with NULL values It returns rows for the combined queries after eliminating duplicates It returns the common rows from the combined queries None of the above Answer: C. INTERSECT Returns only the rows that occur in both queries' result sets, sorting them and removing duplicates. 10.What is true about the MINUS operator? It returns rows from the first query but not from the second query It returns rows for the second query but not from the first query It returns duplicate rows for the combined queries It returns rows for the combined queries ignoring the NULL values Answer: A. MINUS Returns only the rows in the first result set that do not appear in the second result set, sorting them and removing duplicates. 11.What is the precedence of the set operators UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT and MINUS? UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT and MINUS MINUS, UNION, UNION ALL and INTERSECT INTERSECT, MINUS, UNION ALL, UNION Equal precedence Answer: D. SET operators have an equal precedence. 12.What is the order of evaluation of set operators? Left to Right Right to Left Random Evaluation Top to Bottom Answer: A, D. Assuming that there are no grouping of queries using parentheses, the SET operators will be evaluated from top to bottom and left to right horizontally. 13.In which of the following cases, parenthesis should be specified? When INTERSECT is used with other set operators When UNION is used with UNION ALL When MINUS is used for the queries None of the above Answer: A. Using parenthesis will explicitly change the order of evaluation when INTERSECT is used with other operators. 14.What is true about the SELECT clause when SET operators are used? There is no restriction on the columns being selected The columns, expressions used in the SELECT clause must match in number in the combined queries The columns, expressions used in the SELECT clause must be N in the first query and N-1 in the subsequent combined queries Both B and C Answer: B. All the combined should have the same no. of columns when using SET operators. The corresponding columns in the queries that make up a compound query must be of the same data type group. 15.What is true about the SET operators? The SELECT clause should have the same number of columns, data types can be different The SET operators can be used only for combining two queries The data type of each column in the 2nd query must match the data type of its corresponding column in the first query. None of the above Answer: C. All the combined should have the same no. of columns when using SET operators. The corresponding columns in the queries that make up a compound query must be of the same data type group. 16.Where can the ORDER BY clause be used in case when SET operators are used? In each of the queries being combined In the first query only At the very end of the compound query None of the above Answer: C. If the ORDER BY clause is used in between any of the queries joined using SET operators, it will throw an ORA error. 17.What is true about the queries that have SET operators in their WHERE clause? These queries must have the same no. and data type of columns in their SELECT clause. The no. of columns used in the WHERE clause query and the main SELECT can be different The no. of columns used in the WHERE clause should be the same, the data type can be different None of the above Answer: A. All the combined should have the same no. of columns when using SET operators. The corresponding columns in the queries that make up a compound query must be of the same data type group. 18.What is true about the columns in the second query with respect to the columns in the first query? The column in the 2nd query must be in the same data type group as the corresponding column in the 1st query If a column in the 1st query is a NUMBER, the corresponding column in the 2nd query should be a VARCHAR2 If a column in the 1st query is a NUMBER, the corresponding column in the 2nd query should be also be NUMBER. None of the above Answer: A, C. 19.What among the following is true about SET operators? SET operators cannot be used in sub-queries SET operators can only be used in the WHERE clause ORDER BY can be used for all queries combined by a SET operator SET operators can be used in sub-queries Answer: D. 20.What is the best way to change the precedence of SET operators given the fact that they have equal precedence? The order of usage of the SET operators can be changed to change the precedence The equal precedence cannot be changed Parenthesis can be used to change the precedence None of the above Answer: C. Parenthesis can be used to group the specific queries in order to change the precedence explicitly. Parentheses are preferred over other SET operators during execution. 21.What can be said about duplicate values and SET operators? No SET operator displays duplicate values All SET operators can display duplicate values Only UNION ALL operator displays duplicate values None of the above Answer: C. UNION, INTERSECT and MINUS automatically eliminate duplicate values Examine the structure of the EMPLOYEES and DEPARTMENTS tables and consider the following query and answer the questions 22 and 23. SQL> DESC employees

 22.What will be displayed in the result of this query? It will display distinct department id(s) contained jointly in EMPLOYEES and DEPARTMENTS table It will throw ORA error No rows selected None of the above Answer: A. UNION Returns the combined rows from two queries, sorting them and removing duplicates. 23.What is true about the query given above? This query returns an ORA error It executes successfully but gives no results Queries from different tables cannot be used with the SET operators The query executes successfully and gives the results as expected Answer: D. A compound query is one query made up of several queries using different tables. 24.What is the default sorting order of the results when UNION ALL operator is used? Descending Ascending Either A or B All of the above Answer: B. A compound query will by default return rows sorted across all the columns,from left to right in ascending order.The only exception is UNION ALL, where the rows will not be sorted. The only place where an ORDER BY clause is permitted is at the end of the compound query. 25.What will be the output of the compound query in which columns in the SELECT are of CHAR and equal length? The output will have VARCHAR2 data type of equal length The output will have CHAR data type of equal length The output will have CHAR data type of different lengths The output will have NUMBER data type of equal length Answer: B. The columns in the queries that make up a compound query can have different names, but the output result set will use the names of the columns in the first query. The corresponding columns in the queries that make up a compound query must be of the same data type group. 26.What will be the output of the compound query in which columns in the SELECT are of CHAR and different lengths? The output will have VARCHAR2 data type of equal length The output will have CHAR data type of equal length The output will have CHAR data type of different lengths The output will have VARCHAR2 data type with the length of the larger CHAR value Answer: D. While the selected column lists do not have to be exactly the same data type, they must be from the same data type group. The result set of the compound query will have columns with the higher level of precision. 27.What will be the output of a compound query if either or both queries select values of VARCHAR2? The output will have VARCHAR2 data type. The output will have CHAR data type of equal length The output will have CHAR data type of different lengths The output will have VARCHAR2 data type with the length of the larger CHAR value Answer: A. While the selected column lists do not have to be exactly the same data type, they must be from the same data type group. The result set of the compound query will have columns with the higher level of precision. 28.What is true if the compound queries select numeric data? There will be an equal precedence of the numeric values, operators The return values will be determined by the numeric precedence The return values will be of NUMBER data type None of the above Answer: B, C. While the selected column lists do not have to be exactly the same data type, they must be from the same data type group. The result set of the compound query will have columns with the higher level of precision. 29.What will happen if the SELECT list of the compound queries returns both a VARCHAR2 and a NUMBER data type result? Oracle will convert them implicitly and return a VARCHAR2 data type result Oracle will convert them implicitly and return a NUMBER data type result An ORA error is thrown None of the above Answer: C. Oracle does not convert data types implicitly. 30.What is true about the UNION operator? It eliminates the duplicate values ignoring NULL values It returns duplicate values ignoring NULL values It returns duplicate values including NULL values It eliminates duplicate values and does not ignore NULL values Answer: D. NULL values are not ignored when the UNION operator is used 31.What can be said about the names and columns of a SQL query which uses the UNION operator? The names of the columns should be identical The names and data type of the columns should be identical The names of the columns need not be identical None of the above Answer: C. The columns in the queries that make up a compound query can have different names, but the output result set will use the names of the columns in the first query. Consider the following exhibit of the JOB_HISTORY table and the query that follows. Answer the questions 32 and 33 below the query. SQL> desc job_history

From job_history; 34.Assuming that an employee with ID 121 has held 2 job IDs in his tenure in the company. Considering the above query, how many times will his records be displayed in the results? Once Twice Thrice None of the above Answer: B. UNION Returns the combined rows from two queries, sorting them and removing duplicates. Duplicity is measured by the combination of columns and not the individual column separately. 35.Assuming that the employee with ID 121 held two positions in two different departments - 10 and 20 in the company.He worked as 'SA_REP' in both the departments 10 and 20. What will be the outcome of the above query ? 2 rows 3 rows No rows ORA error Answer: B. 36.Which statements best describes the inference drawn from the questions 34 and 35? There are duplicate values for job codes The query executes but results produced are unexpected There are no duplicate values for departments None of the above Answer: C. As the combination of the job codes and departments is unique, there are no duplicates obtained. 37.What will be the sorting in the result set obtained by the query? Descending on Employee ID Descending on Job ID Ascending on Employee ID Ascending on Department ID Answer: C. The default sorting will be ascending based on the first column i.e.: Employee ID in this case.However, this behavior can be modified by placing a single ORDER BY clause at the end. 38.Which of the following operators will be used to obtain duplicate records from the component queries? UNION UNION ALL MINUS None of the above Answer: B. UNION ALL doesn't eliminates the duplicate values. 39.What is the difference between the UNION and the UNION ALL operators? There is no difference UNION ALL displays duplicate values too The output in the case of UNION ALL is not sorted by default None of the above Answer: B, C. When used with two SELECT statements, the UNION set operator returns the results of both queries. However, if there are any duplicates, they are removed, and the duplicated record is listed only once. To include duplicates in the results, use the UNION ALL set operator 40.What is true about the INTERSECT operator? The number of columns and data types of the columns in the component queries should be the same The names of the columns and data types of the columns in the component queries should be the same Both A and B None of the above Answer: A. This is common property criteria feature of SET operators. 41.What can be said about the result set if the order of the intersected tables is altered when using INTERSECT? The result is altered The result remains the same The sorting changes on alteration None of the above Answer: B. 42.What among the following is true about the INTERSECT operator? It ignores NULL values It does not ignore NULL values It returns all the rows from the first component query None of the above Answer: B. Answer the related questions 43 and 44 given below. 43.You need to display the names and job IDs of those employees who currently have a job title that is the same as their previous one.

The result will be the same The result will be different The result will be the same but the order will be different None of the above Answer: A. The result can be interpreted as - the employees who have worked with the same job title in the same department. 45.What is true about the MINUS operator? It returns all the rows from all the component queries It returns only the common rows from all the component queries It returns all the rows from the first query and not from the subsequent queries It returns all distinct rows selected by the first query, but not present in the subsequent queries Answer: D. MINUS set operator removes the second query's results from the output if they are also found in the first query's results 46.What can be said regarding the number of columns and data types of the component queries when a MINUS operator is used? They should be the same, the data type might be different but they should belong to the same data type group. They should be the same along with the names of the columns Both A and B None of the above Answer: A. Common feature of SET operators. 47.You need to display the employee IDs of the employees who have not changed their jobs even once during tenure in the company.

It throws an error as TO_CHAR (NULL) cannot be used It executes successfully and gives the values for employees' id, first_name and current job role including duplicate rows It executes successfully and gives the values for employees' id, first_name and all jobs held by the employees excluding duplicate rows None of the above Answer: C. Each query must contain the same number of columns, which are compared positionally. NULL can be substituted in place of column which is missing in the other query within the same compound query. 49.Considering the above query, if the UNION operator is replaced by the MINUS operator, what will the result mean? The result shows those employees who have an entry in the JOB_HISTORY table The result shows those employees who do not have an entry in the JOB_HISTORY, but they are present in the EMPLOYEES table Either of A or B None of the above Answer: B. MINUS gives the unique results that are present in the first query but not the second query. Consider the exhibit given below and answer the questions 50 and 51 that follow: 50.What will be the outcome of the following query? SELECT AU_DETAILS 
FROM AUDIT
UNION
SELECT AU_DETAILS
FROM AUDIT_YEARLY; It executes successfully giving the correct results including the duplicate values It executes successfully giving the correct results excluding the duplicate values It throws an ORA error None of the above Answer: C. CLOB or LONG columns cannot be in the SELECT clause when using the UNION set operators. 51.What will be the outcome of the query if UNION is replaced with UNION ALL? It will execute successfully giving the correct results including duplicate values It throws an ORA error It will execute successfully giving the correct results excluding duplicate values It executes successfully but gives the incorrect results. Answer: B. .UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT and MINUS operators when used with a LONG or CLOB column throws error. 52.Assume that there are 4 component queries. How many SET operators can be used to combine them in a single compound query? 1 2 4 3 Answer: D. The SET operator to be used will are N-1 where N is the number of component queries. 53.What are SET operators called owning to the fact that two or more SELECTs are involved based on columns instead of rows when SET operators are used? Horizontal joins Cartesian Joins Vertical joins Outer joins Answer: C. 54.What is the difference between a UNION and INTERSECT operators? (Choose only the best difference) UNION combines the results of two component queries into one result set with duplicate values INTERSECT returns only those rows that are returned by each of the two component queries UNION gives the distinct values from the component queries, INTERSECT gives the common values from the component queries Both B and C Answer: C. Examine the structure of the EMPLOYEES table and consider the following query. Answer the questions 55 to 60 that follow. SQL> DESC employees

Which of the following operators should be used to get the required results? UNION UNION ALL INTERSECT None of the above Answer: B. UNION ALL Returns the combined rows from two queries without sorting or removing duplicates. 56.You need to display all the duplicate values along with all the values existing in the result set from both the queries. Which of the following SET operators you can use in the above given queries? INTERSECT UNION MINUS None of the above Answer: D. UNION ALL will give the unsorted results with duplicates. 57.What is the difference between the result sets when using a UNION and a UNION ALL set operators? Result set from UNION ALL is filtered including duplicate values Result set from UNION is filtered and sorted including duplicate values Result set from UNION ALL is not sorted and it has duplicate values Result set from UNION is filtered and sorted without duplicate values Answer: C, D. 58.The UNION operator has more overhead on the database than the UNION ALL. What is wrong in this statement? The statement is correct UNION ALL operator has more overhead on the Data base than the UNION operator UNION has to sort and eliminate duplicates which results into additional overhead None of the above Answer: A, C. UNION has to perform more tasks than UNION ALL because it sorts and deduplicates the result sets. Hence it is recommended that unless distinct rows are required, UNION ALL should be used. 59.What will be the outcome if the two queries given above are combined using the INTERSECT operator? It will display only those employees who are Clerks in the Department 10 It will display all those employees who are in the department 10 It will display all the Clerks. None of the above Answer: A.

INTERSECT follows the 'AND' Boolean logic, UNION follows the 'OR' Boolean logic UNION follows the 'OR' Boolean logic, whereas INTERSECT follows the 'AND' logic Either of A or B None of the above Answer: A. 61.In which of the following SET operators, changing the order of the component queries will change the result set? UNION UNION ALL MINUS INTERSECT Answer: C. MINUS Returns only the rows in the first result set that do not appear in the second result set, sorting them and removing duplicates. Consider the following query and answer the questions 62 to 66 that follow: SELECT 4 from dual
INTERSECT
SELECT 1 from dual; 62.What will be the outcome of the given query? No rows 4 1 NULL Answer: A. No rows will be selected as the INTERSECT operator will not get any common results from both the queries - INTERSECT operators gives common results present in query 1 AND query 2. 63.What will be the outcome of the query if the INTERSECT operator is replaced with MINUS operator? 3 4 0 1 Answer: B. MINUS gives results that are present in the first query and not present in the second query. 64.What will be the outcome of the above query if the INTERSECT operator is replaced with the UNION operator? 1 4 4 1 NULL 0 Answer: A. UNION will produce distinct rows in the result set in ascending order. 65.What will be the outcome of the above query if the INTERSECT operator is replaced with the UNION ALL operator? 4 1 0 NULL 1 4 Answer: A. UNION ALL displays the results as they are positioned in the query without sorting them. 66.What will be the outcome if the above query is modified as below? SELECT 1 from dual
UNION ALL
SELECT 4 from dual; 1 4 4 1 NULL None of the above Answer: A. Examine the JOB_HISTORY_ARCHIVE table structure. It is a backup table for the JOB_HISTORY table with no additional column.
