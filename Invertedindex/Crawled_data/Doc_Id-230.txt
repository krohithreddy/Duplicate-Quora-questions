Memcached append command is used to add data in an existing key. This data is added at the end of the previous value. Syntax The basic syntax of Memcached append command is as shown below − 
append key flags exptime bytes [noreply]
value
 The keywords in the syntax are as described below − key - It is the name of the unique key by which data is accessed. flags - It is the 32-bit unsigned integer that the server stores with the data provided by the user, and returns along with the data when the item is retrieved. exptime - It is the expiration time (seconds) of data stored in cache. A 0 value means "never expire", i.e. it should not be removed from the cache unless required. If the exptime is more than 30 days then Memcached interprets it as UNIX timestamp for expiration. bytes - This is the length of the data in bytes that needs to be stored in Memcached. noreply (optional) - This parameter informs the server not to send any reply. value - It is the data that needs to be stored. The data needs to be given on the new line after executing the command with the above options. Example In the following example - First we store a key (tutorials) and value (memcached) to Memcached Then, We retrieve the value using get command and check it Then, we append "redis" to the key tutorials and, we retrieve it and check again. 
set tutorials 0 900 9
memcached
STORED
get tutorials
VALUE tutorials 0 14
memcached
END
append tutorials 0 900 5
redis
STORED
get tutorials
VALUE tutorials 0 14
memcachedredis
END Output The output of the append command is as shown below − 
STORED
 STORED indicates success. NOT_STORED indicates the key does not exist in the Memcached server. CLIENT_ERROR indicates error. Append Data Using Java Application To append data in a Memcached server, you need to use the Memcached append method. Example 
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

import net.spy.memcached.MemcachedClient;

public class MemcachedJava {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
   
      try{
   
         // Connecting to Memcached server on localhost
         MemcachedClient mcc = new MemcachedClient(new InetSocketAddress("127.0.0.1", 11211));
         System.out.println("Connection to server sucessful.");

         // add data to memcached server
         Future fo = mcc.set("tutorialspoint", 900, "Free Education");

         // print status of set method
         System.out.println("set status:" + fo.get());

         // retrieve and check the value from cache
         System.out.println("tutorialspoint value in cache - " + mcc.get("tutorialspoint"));

         // try to add data with existing key
         Future fo = mcc.append("tutorialspoint", 900, " for All");

         // print status of set method
         System.out.println("append status:" + fo.get());
         
         // retrieve and check the value from cache
         System.out.println("tutorialspoint value in cache - " + mcc.get("codingground"));

         // Shutdowns the memcached client
         mcc.shutdown();
         
      }catch(Exception ex)
         System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
   }
}
 Output On compiling and executing the program, you get to see the following output − 
Connection to server successful.
set status:true
tutorialspoint value in cache - Free Education
append status:true
tutorialspoint value in cache - Free Education for All
