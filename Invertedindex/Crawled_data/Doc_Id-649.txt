The CHECK Constraint enables a condition to check the value being entered into a record. If the condition evaluates to false, the record violates the constraint and isn't entered the table. Example For example, the following program creates a new table called CUSTOMERS and adds five columns. Here, we add a CHECK with AGE column, so that you cannot have any CUSTOMER who is below 18 years. 
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(
   ID   INT              NOT NULL,
   NAME VARCHAR (20)     NOT NULL,
   AGE  INT              NOT NULL CHECK (AGE >= 18),
   ADDRESS  CHAR (25) ,
   SALARY   DECIMAL (18, 2),       
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
 If the CUSTOMERS table has already been created, then to add a CHECK constraint to AGE column, you would write a statement like the one given below. 
ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS
   MODIFY AGE INT NOT NULL CHECK (AGE >= 18 );
 You can also use the following syntax, which supports naming the constraint in multiple columns as well âˆ’ 
ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS
   ADD CONSTRAINT myCheckConstraint CHECK(AGE >= 18);
 DROP a CHECK Constraint To drop a CHECK constraint, use the following SQL syntax. This syntax does not work with MySQL. 
ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS
   DROP CONSTRAINT myCheckConstraint;
