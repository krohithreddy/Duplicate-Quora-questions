PostgreSQL MIN function is used to find out the record with minimum value among a record set. To understand the MIN function, consider the table COMPANY having records as follows − 
testdb# select * from COMPANY;
 id | name  | age | address   | salary
----+-------+-----+-----------+--------
  1 | Paul  |  32 | California|  20000
  2 | Allen |  25 | Texas     |  15000
  3 | Teddy |  23 | Norway    |  20000
  4 | Mark  |  25 | Rich-Mond |  65000
  5 | David |  27 | Texas     |  85000
  6 | Kim   |  22 | South-Hall|  45000
  7 | James |  24 | Houston   |  10000
(7 rows)
 Now, based on the above table, suppose you want to fetch minimum value of salary, then you can do so by simply using the following command − 
testdb=# SELECT MIN(salary) FROM company;
 The above given PostgreSQL statement will produce the following result − 
  min
-------
 10000
(1 row)
 You can find all the records with the minimum value for each name using the GROUP BY clause as follows − 
testdb=# SELECT id, name, MIN(salary) FROM company GROUP BY id, name;
 The above given PostgreSQL statement will produce the following result − 
 id | name  |  min
----+-------+-------
  4 | Mark  | 65000
  7 | James | 10000
  6 | Kim   | 45000
  3 | Teddy | 20000
  2 | Allen | 15000
  5 | David | 85000
  1 | Paul  | 20000
(7 rows)
 You can use the MIN Function along with the MAX function to find out the minimum value as well. Try out the following example − 
testdb=# SELECT MIN(salary), MAX(salary) max FROM company;
 The above given PostgreSQL statement will produce the following result − 
  min  |  max
-------+-------
 10000 | 85000
(1 row)
