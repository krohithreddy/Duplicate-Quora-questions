You can achieve Insert query statement in HSQLDB by using the INSERT INTO command. You have to provide the user-defined data following the column field order from the table. Syntax Following is the generic syntax to INSERT a query. 
INSERT INTO table_name (field1, field2,...fieldN)
VALUES (value1, value2,...valueN );
 To insert a string type data into a table, you will have to use double or single quotes to provide string value into the insert query statement. Example Let us consider an example that inserts a record into a table named tutorials_tbl with the values id = 100, title = Learn PHP, Author = John Poul, and the submission date is current date. Following is the query for the given example. 
INSERT INTO tutorials_tbl VALUES (100,'Learn PHP', 'John Poul', NOW());
 After execution of the above query, you will receive the following output − 
1 row effected
 HSQLDB – JDBC Program Here is the JDBC program to insert the record into the table with the given values, id =100, title = Learn PHP, Author = John Poul, and the submission date is current date. Take a look at the given program. Save the code into the InserQuery.java file. 
import java.sql.Connection; 
import java.sql.DriverManager; 
import java.sql.Statement;  

public class InsertQuery {
   public static void main(String[] args) { 
      Connection con = null; 
      Statement stmt = null; 
      int result = 0; 
      try { 
         Class.forName("org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver"); 
         con = DriverManager.getConnection( "jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/testdb", "SA", ""); 
         stmt = con.createStatement(); 
         result = stmt.executeUpdate("INSERT INTO tutorials_tbl 
            VALUES (100,'Learn PHP', 'John Poul', NOW())"); 
         con.commit(); 
      }catch (Exception e) { 
         e.printStackTrace(System.out); 
      } 
      System.out.println(result+" rows effected"); 
      System.out.println("Rows inserted successfully"); 
   } 
} 
 You can start the database using the following command. 
\>cd C:\hsqldb-2.3.4\hsqldb 
hsqldb>java -classpath lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.server.Server --database.0 
file:hsqldb/demodb --dbname.0 testdb 
 Compile and execute the above program using the following command. 
\>javac InsertQuery.java 
\>java InsertQuery 
 After execution of the above command, you will receive the following output − 
1 rows effected 
Rows inserted successfully 
 Try to insert the following records into the tutorials_tbl table by using the INSERT INTO command. Id Title Author Submission Date 101 Learn C Yaswanth Now() 102 Learn MySQL Abdul S Now() 103 Learn Excell Bavya kanna Now() 104 Learn JDB Ajith kumar Now() 105 Learn Junit Sathya Murthi Now()
