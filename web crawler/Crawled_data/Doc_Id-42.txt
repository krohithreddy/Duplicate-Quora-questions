Introduction A role is a database object that groups multiple privileges that can be assigned to users, groups, PUBLIC or other roles by using GRANT statement. Restrictions on roles A role cannot own database objects. Permissions and roles granted to groups are not considered when you create the following database objects. Package Containing static SQL Views Materialized Query Tables (MQT) Triggers SQL Routines Creating and granting membership in roles Syntax: [To create a new role] 
db2 create role <role_name> 
 Example: [To create a new role named ‘sales’ to add some table to be managed by some user or group] 
db2 create role sales 
 Output: 
DB20000I The SQL command completed successfully. 
 Granting role from DBADM to a particular table Syntax: [To grant permission of a role to a table] 
db2 grant select on table <table_name> to role <role_name> 
 Example: [To add permission to manage a table ‘shope.books’ to role ‘sales’] 
db2 grant select on table shope.books to role sales 
 Output: 
DB20000I  The SQL command completed successfully. 
 Security administrator grants role to the required users. (Before you use this command, you need to create the users.) Syntax: [To add users to a role]
