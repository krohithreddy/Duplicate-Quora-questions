This chapter introduces various data types used in DB2. Introduction In DB2 Database tables, each column has its own data type depending on developerâ€™s requirements. The data type is said to be type and range of the values in columns of a table. Built-in data types Datetime TIME: It represents the time of the day in hours, minutes and seconds. TIMESTAMP: It represents seven values of the date and time in the form of year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds and microseconds. DATE: It represents date of the day in three parts in the form of year, month and day. String Character CHAR (fixed length): Fixed length of Character strings. Varying length VARCHAR: Varying length character strings. CLOB: large object strings, you use this when a character string might exceed the limits of the VARCHAR data type. Graphic GRAPHIC Fixed length: Fixed length graphic strings that contains double-byte characters Varying length VARGRAPHIC: Varying character graphic string that contains double bye characters. DBCLOB: large object type Binary BLOB (varying length): binary string in large object BOOLEAN: In the form of 0 and 1. Signed numeric Exact Binary integer SMALLINT [16BIT]: Using this you can insert small int values into columns INTEGER [32BIT]: Using this you can insert large int values into columns BIGINT [64BIT]: Using this you can insert larger int values into columns Decimal DECIMAL (packed) DECFLOAT (decimal floating point): Using this, you can insert decimal floating point numbers Approximate Floating points REAL (single precision): Using this data type, you can insert single precision floating point numbers. DOUBLE (double precision): Using this data type, you can insert double precision floating point numbers. eXtensible Mark-up Language XML: You can store XML data into this data type column.
