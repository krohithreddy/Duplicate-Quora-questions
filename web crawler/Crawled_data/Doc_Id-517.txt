Answer : C Show Answer Q 15 - Consider the following code − 
DECLARE
   -- Global variables 
   num number := 95; 
BEGIN 
   dbms_output.put_line('num: ' || num1);
   DECLARE 
      -- Local variables
      num number := 195; 
     BEGIN 
      dbms_output.put_line('num: ' || num1);
     END; 
END;

DECLARE
   c_id := 1;
   c_name  customers.name%type;
   c_addr customers.address%type;
  BEGIN
   SELECT name, address INTO c_name, c_addr
   FROM customers
   WHERE id = c_id;
END;
 A - You cannot use the SELECT INTO statement of SQL to assign values to PL/SQL variables. B - The SELECT INTO statement here is wrong. It should be: SELECT c_name, c_address INTO name, addr C - The WHERE statement is wrong. It should be: WHERE id := c_id; D - The variable c_id should be declared as a type-compatible variable as − c_id customers.id%type := 1; Answer : D Show Answer Q 17 - Which of the following is not true about PL/SQL constants and literals?

   b number (2) := 10;
BEGIN
   
   IF ( a <= b ) THEN
      dbms_output.put_line(a);
   END IF;

   IF ( b >= a ) THEN
      dbms_output.put_line(a);
   END IF;
   
   IF ( a <> b ) THEN
      dbms_output.put_line(b);
   
   END IF;

END;
 A - 2 B - 21 C - 10 D - 21, 10 Answer : C Show Answer Q 19 - What would be printed when the following code is executed? 
DECLARE
      x   NUMBER;
    BEGIN
      
       x := 5;
       x := 10;
       dbms_output.put_line(-x);
       dbms_output.put_line(+x);
       x := -10;
       dbms_output.put_line(-x);
       dbms_output.put_line(+x);
   END;
 A - -10      10      10      -10 B - 10      -10      10      -10 C - -10      +10      +10      -10 D - 10      -10      -10      10 Answer : A Show Answer Q 20 - To get the server output result and display it into the screen, you need to write − A - set serveroutput on B - set server output on C - set dbmsoutput on D - set dbms output on Answer : A Show Answer Q 21 - Which of the following is not true about PL/SQL decision making structures? A - The IF statement associates a condition with a sequence of statements enclosed by the keywords THEN and END IF. B - The IF statement also adds the keyword ELSE followed by an alternative sequence of statement. C - The IF-THEN-ELSIF statement allows you to choose between several alternatives. D - PL/SQL does not have a CASE statement. Answer : D Show Answer Q 22 - Which of the following is true about the following code snippet? 
DECLARE
   a number(3) := 100;
BEGIN
   IF (a = 50 ) THEN
      dbms_output.put_line('Value of a is 10' );
   ELSEIF ( a = 75 ) THEN
      dbms_output.put_line('Value of a is 20' );
   ELSE
       dbms_output.put_line('None of the values is matching');
   END IF;
   dbms_output.put_line('Exact value of a is: '|| a ); 
END;

 A - It has syntax error. B - It will print 'None of the values is matching'. C - It will print None of the values is matching Exact value of a is: 100 D - None of the above. Answer : A Explanation the ELSIF statement is wrongly written as ELSEIF Show Answer Q 23 - Which of the following is true about the following code snippet? 
DECLARE
   a number(3) := 100;
BEGIN
   IF (a = 50 ) THEN
      dbms_output.put_line('Value of a is 10' );
   ELSIF ( a = 75 )
      dbms_output.put_line('Value of a is 20' );
   ELSE
       dbms_output.put_line('None of the values is matching');
   END IF;
   dbms_output.put_line('Exact value of a is: '|| a ); 
END;
 A - It has syntax error. B - It will print 'None of the values is matching'. C - It will print None of the values is matching Exact value of a is: 100 D - None of the above. Answer : A Explanation it has the THEN keyword missing in the ELSIF statement Show Answer Q 24 - Which of the following is true about the following PL/SQL CASE statement syntax? 
CASE selector
    WHEN 'value1' THEN S1;
    WHEN 'value2' THEN S2;
    WHEN 'value3' THEN S3;
    ...
    ELSE Sn;  -- default case
END CASE;
 A - It is wrongly written. B - It is perfectly written. C - It is you can specify the literal NULL for all the S expressions and the default Sn. D - All the expressions like the selector, the value and the returns values, need not be of the same data type. Answer : B Show Answer Q 25 - What is the output of the following code? 
DECLARE
   grade char(1) := 'B';
BEGIN
   case 
      when grade = 'A' then dbms_output.put_line('Excellent');
      when grade = 'B' then dbms_output.put_line('Very good');
      when grade = 'C' then dbms_output.put_line('Well done');
      when grade = 'D' then dbms_output.put_line('You passed');
      when grade = 'F' then dbms_output.put_line('Better try again');
      else dbms_output.put_line('No such grade');
   end case;
END;
 A - It has syntax error, so there will not be any output. B - B C - Very good D - No such grade Answer : C Show Answer Answer Sheet Question Number Answer Key 1 C 2 D 3 D 4 B 5 D 6 A 7 B 8 D 9 A 10 D 11 D 12 A 13 B 14 C 15 B 16 D 17 B 18 C 19 A 20 A 21 D 22 A 23 A 24 B 25 C Download plsql_questions_answers.htm
