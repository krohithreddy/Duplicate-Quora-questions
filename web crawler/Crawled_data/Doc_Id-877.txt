Attribute Type Description length unsigned long It gives the number of nodes in this map. The range of valid child node indices is 0 to length-1 inclusive. Methods The following table lists the methods of the NamedNodeMap object. S.No. Methods & Description 1 getNamedItem () Retrieves the node specified by name. 2 getNamedItemNS () Retrieves a node specified by local name and namespace URI. 3 item () Returns the indexth item in the map. If index is greater than or equal to the number of nodes in this map, this returns null. 4 removeNamedItem () Removes a node specified by name. 5 removeNamedItemNS () Removes a node specified by local name and namespace URI. 6 setNamedItem () Adds a node using its nodeName attribute. If a node with that name is already present in this map, it is replaced by the new one. 7 setNamedItemNS () Adds a node using its namespaceURI and localName. If a node with that namespace URI and that local name is already present in this map, it is replaced by the new one. Replacing a node by itself has no effect.
