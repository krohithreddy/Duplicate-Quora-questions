Memcached get command is used to get the value stored at key. No value is returned if the key does not exist. Syntax The basic syntax of Memcached get command is as shown below − 
get key
 More than one key can be supplied with space between them as shown here − 
get key1 key2 key3
 Example In the following example, we use tutorialspoint as the key and store memcached in it with an expiration time of 900 seconds. 
set tutorialspoint 0 900 9
memcached
STORED
get tutorialspoint
VALUE tutorialspoint 0 9
memcached
END
 Get Data Using Java Application To get data from a Memcached server, we use Memcached get method. Example 
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

import net.spy.memcached.MemcachedClient;

public class MemcachedJava {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
   
      try{
   
         // Connecting to Memcached server on localhost
         MemcachedClient mcc = new MemcachedClient(new InetSocketAddress("127.0.0.1", 11211));
         System.out.println("Connection to server sucessful.");

         // add data to memcached server
         Future fo = mcc.set("tutorialspoint", 900, "Free Education");

         // print status of set method
         System.out.println("set status:" + fo.get());

         // retrieve value from cache using get method
         System.out.println("tutorialspoint value in cache - " + mcc.get("tutorialspoint"));

         // Shutdowns the memcached client
         mcc.shutdown();
         
      }catch(Exception ex)
         System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
   }
}
 Output On compiling and executing the program, you get to see the following output − 
Connection to server sucessful.
set status:true
tutorialspoint value in cache - Free Education
