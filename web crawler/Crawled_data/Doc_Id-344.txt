It is very easy to drop an existing MySQLi table, but you need to be very careful while deleting any existing table because data lost will not be recovered after deleting a table. Syntax Here is generic SQL syntax to drop a MySQLi table − 
DROP TABLE table_name ;
 Dropping Tables from Command Prompt This needs just to execute DROP TABLE SQL command at mysql> prompt. Example Here is an example, which deletes tutorials_inf − 
root@host# mysql -u root -p
Enter password:*******

mysql> use TUTORIALS;
Database changed

mysql> DROP TABLE tutorials_inf
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.8 sec)

mysql>
 Dropping Tables Using PHP Script To drop an existing table in any database, you would need to use PHP function mysqli_query(). You will pass its second argument with proper SQL command to drop a table. Example 
<html>
   <head>
      <title>Dropping MySQLi Tables</title>
   </head>
   
   <body>
      <?php  
         $host = 'localhost:3306';  
         $user = 'root';  
         $pass = '';  
         $dbname = 'TUTORIALS';  
         $conn = mysqli_connect($host, $user, $pass,$dbname);  
         
         if(!$conn) {  
            die('Could not connect: '.mysqli_connect_error());  
         }  
         echo 'Connected successfully<br/>';  
         $sql = "DROP TABLE tutorials_inf";
         
         if(mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {  
            echo "Table is deleted successfully";  
         } else {  
            echo "Table is not deleted successfully\n";
         }  
         mysqli_close($conn);  
      ?>  
   </body>
</html>
 The sample output should be like this − 
Connected successfully
Table is deleted successfully
