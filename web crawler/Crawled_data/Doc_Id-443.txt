The SQL Reference of the OrientDB database provides several commands to create, alter, and drop databases. The following statement is a basic syntax of Create Database command. 
CREATE DATABASE <database-url> [<user> <password> <storage-type> [<db-type>]]
 Following are the details about the options in the above syntax. <database-url> − Defines the URL of the database. URL contains two parts, one is <mode> and the second one is <path>. <mode> − Defines the mode, i.e. local mode or remote mode. <path> − Defines the path to the database. <user> − Defines the user you want to connect to the database. <password> − Defines the password for connecting to the database. <storage-type> − Defines the storage types.
