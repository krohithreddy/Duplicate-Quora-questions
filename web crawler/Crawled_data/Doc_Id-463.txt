Load Record is used to load a particular record from the schema. Load record will load the record with the help of Record ID. It is represented with @rid symbol in the resultset. The following statement is the basic syntax of the LOAD Record command. 
LOAD RECORD <record-id> 
 Where <record-id> defines the record id of the record you want to load. If you donâ€™t know the Record ID of a particular record, then you can execute any query against the table. In the result-set you will find the Record ID (@rid) of the respective record. Example Let us consider the same Customer table that we have used in previous chapters. Sr.No. Name Age 1 Satish 25 2 Krishna 26 3 Kiran 29 4 Javeed 21 5 Raja 29 Try the following query to retrieve the record having Record ID @rid: #11:0. 
orientdb {db = demo}> LOAD RECORD #11:0 
 If the above query is executed successfully, you will get the following output. 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 
| Document - @class: Customer        @rid: #11:0           @version: 1      |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 
|                       id | 1                                              | 
|                     name | satish                                         | 
|                      age | 25                                             |
