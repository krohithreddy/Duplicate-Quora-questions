   a number (2) := 21;
   b number (2) := 10;
BEGIN
   
   IF ( a <= b ) THEN
      dbms_output.put_line(a);
   END IF;

   IF ( b >= a ) THEN
      dbms_output.put_line(a);
   END IF;
   
   IF ( a <> b ) THEN
      dbms_output.put_line(b);
   
   END IF;

END;
 A - 2 B - 21 C - 10 D - 21, 10 Answer : C Show Answer Q 3 - Which of the following is true about the following code snippet?

BEGIN
   IF (a = 50 ) THEN
      dbms_output.put_line('Value of a is 10' );
   ELSEIF ( a = 75 ) THEN
      dbms_output.put_line('Value of a is 20' );
   ELSE
       dbms_output.put_line('None of the values is matching');
   END IF;
   dbms_output.put_line('Exact value of a is: '|| a );
