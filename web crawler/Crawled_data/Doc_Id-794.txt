Unfortunately, we do not have TRUNCATE TABLE command in SQLite but you can use SQLite DELETE command to delete complete data from an existing table, though it is recommended to use DROP TABLE command to drop the complete table and re-create it once again. Syntax Following is the basic syntax of DELETE command. 
sqlite> DELETE FROM table_name;
 Following is the basic syntax of DROP TABLE. 
sqlite> DROP TABLE table_name;
 If you are using DELETE TABLE command to delete all the records, it is recommended to use VACUUM command to clear unused space. Example Consider COMPANY table with the following records. 
ID          NAME        AGE         ADDRESS     SALARY
----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
1           Paul        32          California  20000.0
2           Allen       25          Texas       15000.0
3           Teddy       23          Norway      20000.0
4           Mark        25          Rich-Mond   65000.0
5           David       27          Texas       85000.0
6           Kim         22          South-Hall  45000.0
7           James       24          Houston     10000.0
 Following is the example to truncate the above table âˆ’ 
SQLite> DELETE FROM COMPANY;
SQLite> VACUUM;
 Now, COMPANY table is truncated completely and nothing will be the output from SELECT statement.
