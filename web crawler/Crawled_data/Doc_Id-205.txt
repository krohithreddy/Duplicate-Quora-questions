Creation or deletion of databases in MariaDB requires privileges, typically, only given to root users or admins. Under these accounts, you have two options for deleting a database: the mysqladmin binary and a PHP script. Note that deleted databases are irrecoverable, so exercise care in performing this operation. Furthermore, PHP scripts used for deletion do not prompt you with a confirmation before the deletion. mysqladmin binary The following example demonstrates how to use the mysqladmin binary to delete an existing database − 
[root@host]# mysqladmin -u root -p drop PRODUCTS
Enter password:******
mysql> DROP PRODUCTS
ERROR 1008 (HY000): Can't drop database 'PRODUCTS'; database doesn't exist
 PHP Drop Database Script PHP employs the mysql_query function in deleting MariaDB databases. The function uses two parameters, one optional, and returns either a value of “true” when successful, or “false” when not. Syntax Review the following drop database script syntax − 
bool mysql_query( sql, connection );
 The description of the parameters is given below − S.No Parameter & Description 1 sql This required parameter consists of the SQL query needed to perform the operation. 2 connection When not specified, this optional parameter uses the most recent connection used.

<html>
   <head>
      <title>Delete a MariaDB Database</title>
   </head>

   <body>
      <?php
         $dbhost = 'localhost:3036';
         $dbuser = 'root';
         $dbpass = 'rootpassword';
         $conn = mysql_connect($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass);
      
         if(! $conn ) {
            die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
         }
         echo 'Connected successfully<br />';
         
         $sql = 'DROP DATABASE PRODUCTS';
         $retval = mysql_query( $sql, $conn );
         
         if(! $retval ){
            die('Could not delete database: ' . mysql_error());
         }

         echo "Database PRODUCTS deleted successfully\n";
         mysql_close($conn);
      ?>
   </body>
</html>
 On successful deletion, you will see the following output − 
mysql> Database PRODUCTS deleted successfully
