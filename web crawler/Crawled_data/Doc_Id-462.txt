This chapter explains how to get the list of all databases in an instance from the OrientDB command line. The following statement is the basic syntax of the info command. 
LIST DATABASES
 Note − You can use this command only after connecting to a local or remote server. Example Before retrieving the list of databases, we have to connect to the localhost server through the remote server. It is required to remind that the username and password for connecting to the localhost instance is guest and guest respectively, which is configured in the orintdb/config/orientdb-server-config.xml file. You can use the following command to connect to the localhost database server instance. 
orientdb> connect remote:localhost guest 
 It will ask the password. As per the config file password for guest is also guest. If it is successfully connected, you will get the following output. 
Connecting to remote Server instance [remote:localhost] with user 'guest'...OK 
orientdb {server = remote:localhost/}>
 After connecting to the localhost database server you can use the following command to list the databases. 
orientdb {server = remote:localhost/}> list databases
 If it is successfully executed, you will get the following output − 
Found 6 databases: 
* demo (plocal) 
* s2 (plocal) 
* s1 (plocal) 
* GratefulDeadConcerts (plocal) 
* s3 (plocal) 
* sample (plocal) 
orientdb {server = remote:localhost/}>
