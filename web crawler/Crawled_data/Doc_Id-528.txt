 Example Consider our COMPANY table has the following records − 
 id | name  | age | address   | salary
----+-------+-----+-----------+--------
  1 | Paul  |  32 | California|  20000
  2 | Allen |  25 | Texas     |  15000
  3 | Teddy |  23 | Norway    |  20000
  4 | Mark  |  25 | Rich-Mond |  65000
  5 | David |  27 | Texas     |  85000
  6 | Kim   |  22 | South-Hall|  45000
  7 | James |  24 | Houston   |  10000
 The following is the example to ADD a new column in an existing table − 
testdb=# ALTER TABLE COMPANY ADD GENDER char(1);
 Now, COMPANY table is changed and the following would be the output from SELECT statement − 
 id | name  | age | address     | salary | gender
----+-------+-----+-------------+--------+--------
  1 | Paul  |  32 | California  |  20000 |
  2 | Allen |  25 | Texas       |  15000 |
  3 | Teddy |  23 | Norway      |  20000 |
  4 | Mark  |  25 | Rich-Mond   |  65000 |
  5 | David |  27 | Texas       |  85000 |
  6 | Kim   |  22 | South-Hall  |  45000 |
  7 | James |  24 | Houston     |  10000 |
(7 rows)
 The following is the example to DROP gender column from existing table − 
testdb=# ALTER TABLE COMPANY DROP GENDER;
 Now, COMPANY table is changed and the following would be the output from SELECT statement − 
 id | name  | age | address   | salary
----+-------+-----+-----------+--------
  1 | Paul  |  32 | California|  20000
  2 | Allen |  25 | Texas     |  15000
  3 | Teddy |  23 | Norway    |  20000
  4 | Mark  |  25 | Rich-Mond |  65000
  5 | David |  27 | Texas     |  85000
  6 | Kim   |  22 | South-Hall|  45000
  7 | James |  24 | Houston   |  10000
