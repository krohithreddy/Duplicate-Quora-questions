SQL Server SELECT statement is used to fetch the data from a database table which returns data in the form of result table. These result tables are called result-sets. Syntax Following is the basic syntax of SELECT statement − 
SELECT column1, column2, columnN FROM table_name;
 Where, column1, column2...are the fields of a table whose values you want to fetch. If you want to fetch all the fields available in the field, then you can use the following syntax − 
SELECT * FROM table_name;
 Example Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records − 
ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS             SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad           2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi               1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota                2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai              6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal              8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP                  4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore              10000.00 
 Following command is an example, which would fetch ID, Name and Salary fields of the customers available in CUSTOMERS table − 
SELECT ID, NAME, SALARY FROM CUSTOMERS;

ID  NAME          SALARY 
1   Ramesh        2000.00 
2   Khilan        1500.00 
3   kaushik       2000.00 
4   Chaitali      6500.00 
5   Hardik        8500.00 
6   Komal         4500.00 
7   Muffy         10000.00 
 If you want to fetch all the fields of CUSTOMERS table, then use the following query − 
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;
 The above will produce the following output. 
ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS              SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad            2000.00
