Delete Record command is used to delete one or more records completely from the database. The following statement is the basic syntax of the Delete command. 
DELETE FROM <Class>|cluster:<cluster>|index:<index> 
   [LOCK <default|record>] 
   [RETURN <returning>] 
   [WHERE <Condition>*] 
   [LIMIT <MaxRecords>] 
   [TIMEOUT <timeout>]
 Following are the details about the options in the above syntax. LOCK − Specifies how to lock the records between load and update. We have two options to specify Default and Record. RETURN − Specifies an expression to return instead of the number of records. LIMIT − Defines the maximum number of records to update. TIMEOUT − Defines the time you want to allow the update run before it times out. Note − Don’t use DELETE to remove Vertices or Edges because it effects the integrity of the graph. Example Let us consider the Customer table. Sr.No. Name Age 1 Satish 25 2 Krishna 26 3 Kiran 29 4 Javeed 21 Try the following query to delete the record having id = 4. 
orientdb {db = demo}> DELETE FROM Customer WHERE id = 4
 If the above query is executed successfully, you will get the following output. 
Delete 1 record(s) in 0.008000 sec(s).
 To check the record of Customer table you can use the following query. 
Orientdb {db = demo}> SELECT FROM Customer
 If the above query is executed successfully, you will get the following output. 
----+-----+--------+----+-------+---- 
#   |@RID |@CLASS  |id  |name   |age  
----+-----+--------+----+-------+---- 
0   |#11:0|Customer|1   |satish |25   
1   |#11:1|Customer|2   |krishna|26   
2   |#11:2|Customer|3   |kiran  |29
