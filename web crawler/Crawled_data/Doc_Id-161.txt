It is very easy to drop an existing HSQLDB table. However, you need to be very careful while deleting any existing table as any data lost will not be recovered after deleting a table. Syntax Following is a generic SQL syntax to drop a HSQLDB table. 
DROP TABLE table_name;
 Example Let us consider an example to drop a table named employee from the HSQLDB server. Following is the query to drop a table named employee. 
DROP TABLE employee;
 After execution of the above query, you will receive the following output − 
(0) rows effected
 HSQLDB – JDBC Program Following is the JDBC program used to drop the table employee from the HSQLDB server. Save the following code into DropTable.java file. 
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.Statement;

public class DropTable {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Connection con = null;
      Statement stmt = null;
      int result = 0;
      
      try {
         Class.forName("org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver");
         con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/testdb", "SA", "");
         stmt = con.createStatement();
         result = stmt.executeUpdate("DROP TABLE employee");
      }catch (Exception e) {
         e.printStackTrace(System.out);
      }
      
      System.out.println("Table dropped successfully");
   }
}
 You can start the database using the following command. 
\>cd C:\hsqldb-2.3.4\hsqldb
hsqldb>java -classpath lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.server.Server --database.0
file:hsqldb/demodb --dbname.0 testdb
 Compile and execute the above program using the following command. 
\>javac DropTable.java
\>java DropTable
 After execution of the above command, you will receive the following output − 
Table dropped successfully
