Syntax 
array mysqli_get_client_stats ( void )
 Definition and Usage It returns client per-process statistics. Example Try out following example − 
<?php
   $servername = "localhost:3306";
   $username = "root";
   $password = "";
   $dbname = "TUTORIALS";
   $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

   if ($conn->connect_error) {
      die('Connect Error (' . mysqli_connect_errno() . ') '. mysqli_connect_error());
      exit();
   } 
   if (!mysqli_query($conn, "SET a = 1")) {
      printf("Errorcode: %d\n", mysqli_error($conn));
   }
   echo 'Success... ' . mysqli_get_host_info($conn) . "\n";
   print_r(mysqli_get_client_stats());
?>
 The sample output of the above code should be like this −
