In this chapter, we will learn to delete tables. Table deletion is very easy, but remember all deleted tables are irrecoverable. The general syntax for table deletion is as follows − 
DROP TABLE table_name ;
 Two options exist for performing a table drop: use the command prompt or a PHP script. The Command Prompt At the command prompt, simply use the DROP TABLE SQL command − 
root@host# mysql -u root -p
Enter password:*******
mysql> use PRODUCTS;
Database changed
mysql> DROP TABLE products_tbl

mysql> SELECT * from products_tbl
ERROR 1146 (42S02): Table 'products_tbl' doesn't exist
 PHP Drop Table Script PHP provides mysql_query() for dropping tables. Simply pass its second argument the appropriate SQL command − 
<html>
   <head>
      <title>Create a MariaDB Table</title>
   </head>

   <body>
      <?php
         $dbhost = 'localhost:3036';
         $dbuser = 'root';
         $dbpass = 'rootpassword';
         $conn = mysql_connect($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass);
         
         if(! $conn ) {
            die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
         }
         echo 'Connected successfully<br />';
         
         $sql = "DROP TABLE products_tbl";
         mysql_select_db( 'PRODUCTS' );
         $retval = mysql_query( $sql, $conn );
      
         if(! $retval ) {
            die('Could not delete table: ' . mysql_error());
         }
         echo "Table deleted successfully\n";
         
         mysql_close($conn);
      ?>
   </body>
</html>
 On successful table deletion, you will see the following output − 
mysql> Table deleted successfully
