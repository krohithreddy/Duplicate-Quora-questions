Redis Sets are an unordered collection of unique strings. Unique means sets does not allow repition of data in a key. In Redis set add, remove, and test for the existence of members in O(1) (constant time regardless of the number of elements contained inside the Set). The maximum length of a list is 232 - 1 elements (4294967295, more than 4 billion of elements per set). Example 
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> SADD tutorials redis 
(integer) 1 
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> SADD tutorials mongodb 
(integer) 1 
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> SADD tutorials mysql 
(integer) 1 
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> SADD tutorials mysql 
(integer) 0 
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> SMEMBERS tutorials  
1) "mysql" 
2) "mongodb" 
3) "redis"
 In the above example, three values are inserted in Redis set named ‘tutorials’ by the command SADD. Redis Sets Commands Following table lists some basic commands related to sets. S.No Command & Description 1 SADD key member1 [member2] Adds one or more members to a set 2 SCARD key Gets the number of members in a set 3 SDIFF key1 [key2] Subtracts multiple sets 4 SDIFFSTORE destination key1 [key2] Subtracts multiple sets and stores the resulting set in a key 5 SINTER key1 [key2] Intersects multiple sets 6 SINTERSTORE destination key1 [key2] Intersects multiple sets and stores the resulting set in a key 7 SISMEMBER key member Determines if a given value is a member of a set 8 SMOVE source destination member Moves a member from one set to another 9 SPOP key Removes and returns a random member from a set 10 SRANDMEMBER key [count] Gets one or multiple random members from a set 11 SREM key member1 [member2] Removes one or more members from a set 12 SUNION key1 [key2] Adds multiple sets 13 SUNIONSTORE destination key1 [key2] Adds multiple sets and stores the resulting set in a key 14 SSCAN key cursor [MATCH pattern] [COUNT count] Incrementally iterates set elements
