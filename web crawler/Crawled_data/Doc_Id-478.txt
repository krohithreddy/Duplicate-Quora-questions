Truncate Record command is used to delete the values of a particular record. The following statement is the basic syntax of the Truncate command. 
TRUNCATE RECORD <rid>* 
 Where <rid>* indicates the Record ID to truncate. You can use multiple Rids separated by comma to truncate multiple records. It returns the number of records truncated. Example Let us consider the same Customer table that we have used in the previous chapter. Sr.No. Name Age 1 Satish 25 2 Krishna 26 3 Kiran 29 4 Javeed 21 5 Raja 28 Try the following query to truncate the record having Record ID #11:4. 
Orientdb {db = demo}> TRUNCATE RECORD #11:4
 If the above query is executed successfully, you will get the following output. 
Truncated 1 record(s) in 0.008000 sec(s).
 To check the record of Customer table you can use the following query. 
Orientdb {db = demo}> SELECT FROM Customer
 If the above query is executed successfully, you will get the following output. 
----+-----+--------+----+-------+---- 
#   |@RID |@CLASS  |id  |name   |age  
----+-----+--------+----+-------+---- 
0   |#11:0|Customer|1   |satish |25   
1   |#11:1|Customer|2   |krishna|26   
2   |#11:2|Customer|3   |kiran  |29 
3   |#11:3|Customer|4   |javeed |21
