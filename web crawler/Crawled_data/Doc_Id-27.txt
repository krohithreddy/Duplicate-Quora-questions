This chapter describes backup and restore methods of database. Introduction Backup and recovery methods are designed to keep our information safe. In Command Line Interface (CLI) or Graphical User Interface (GUI) using backup and recovery utilities you can take backup or restore the data of databases in DB2 UDB. Logging Log files consist of error logs, which are used to recover from application errors. The logs keep the record of changes in the database. There are two types of logging as described below: Circular logging It is a method where the old transaction logs are overwritten when there is a need to allocate a new transaction log file, thus erasing the sequences of log files and reusing them. You are permitted to take only full back-up in offline mode. i.e., the database must be offline to take the full backup. Archive logging This mode supports for Online Backup and database recovery using log files called roll forward recovery. The mode of backup can be changed from circular to archive by setting logretain or userexit to ON. For archive logging, backup setting database require a directory that is writable for DB2 process. Backup Using Backup command you can take copy of entire database. This backup copy includes database system files, data files, log files, control information and so on. You can take backup while working offline as well as online. Offline backup Syntax: [To list the active applications/databases] 
db2 list application  
 Output: 
Auth Id  Application    Appl.      Application Id

         Name           Handle

ONE      1  
 Syntax: [To force application using app. Handled id] 
db2 "force application (39)"   
 Output: 
DB20000I  The FORCE APPLICATION command completed 
successfully.  

DB21024I  This command is asynchronous and may not 
be effective immediately. 
 Syntax: [To terminate Database Connection] 
db2 terminate  
 Syntax: [To deactivate Database] 
db2 deactivate database one   
 Syntax: [To take the backup file] 
db2 backup database <db_name> to <location>   
 Example: 
db2 backup database one to /home/db2inst1/ 
 Output: 
Backup successful. The timestamp for this backup image is : 
20140722105345  
 Online backup To start, you need to change the mode from Circular logging to Archive Logging. Syntax: [To check if the database is using circular or archive logging] 
db2 get db cfg for one | grep LOGARCH   
 Output: 
First log archive method (LOGARCHMETH1) = OFF  
 Archive compression for logarchmeth1  (LOGARCHCOMPR1) = OFF 
 Options for logarchmeth1              (LOGARCHOPT1) =   
 Second log archive method             (LOGARCHMETH2) = OFF  
 Archive compression for logarchmeth2  (LOGARCHCOMPR2) = OFF  
 Options for logarchmeth2              (LOGARCHOPT2) =   
 In the above output, the highlighted values are [logarchmeth1 and logarchmeth2] in off mode, which implies that the current database in “CIRCULLAR LOGGING” mode. If you need to work with ‘ARCHIVE LOGGING’ mode, you need to change or add path in the variables logarchmeth1 and logarchmeth2 present in the configuration file. Updating logarchmeth1 with required archive directory Syntax: [To make directories] 
mkdir backup 
mkdir backup/ArchiveDest    
 Syntax: [To provide user permissions for folder] 
chown db2inst1:db2iadm1 backup/ArchiveDest 
 Syntax: [To update configuration LOGARCHMETH1] 
db2 update database configuration for one using LOGARCHMETH1 
'DISK:/home/db2inst1/backup/ArchiveDest'
 You can take offline backup for safety, activate the database and connect to it. Syntax: [To take online backup] 
db2 backup database one online to 
/home/db2inst1/onlinebackup/ compress include logs   
 Output: 
db2 backup database one online to 
/home/db2inst1/onlinebackup/ compress include logs    
 Verify Backup file using following command: Syntax: 
db2ckbkp <location/backup file>   
 Example: 
db2ckbkp 
/home/db2inst1/ONE.0.db2inst1.DBPART000.20140722112743.001 
 Listing the history of backup files Syntax: 
db2 list history backup all for one    
 Output: 
                    List History File for one 
  
Number of matching file entries = 4

 Restoring the database from backup To restore the database from backup file, you need to follow the given syntax: Syntax: 
db2 restore database <db_name> from <location> 
taken at <timestamp>    
 Example: 
db2 restore database one from /home/db2inst1/ taken at 
20140722112743  
 Output: 
SQL2523W  Warning!  Restoring to an existing database that is 
different from  
 
the database on the backup image, but have matching names. 
The target database  
 
will be overwritten by the backup version.  The Roll-forward 
recovery logs

associated with the target database will be deleted.
