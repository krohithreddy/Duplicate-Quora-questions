The EXIT statement in PL/SQL programming language has the following two usages − When the EXIT statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and the program control resumes at the next statement following the loop. If you are using nested loops (i.e., one loop inside another loop), the EXIT statement will stop the execution of the innermost loop and start executing the next line of code after the block. Syntax The syntax for an EXIT statement in PL/SQL is as follows − 
EXIT;
 Flow Diagram Example 
DECLARE 
   a number(2) := 10; 
BEGIN 
   -- while loop execution  
   WHILE a < 20 LOOP 
      dbms_output.put_line ('value of a: ' || a); 
      a := a + 1; 
      IF a > 15 THEN 
         -- terminate the loop using the exit statement 
         EXIT; 
      END IF; 
   END LOOP; 
END; 
/ 
 When the above code is executed at the SQL prompt, it produces the following result − 
value of a: 10 
value of a: 11 
value of a: 12 
value of a: 13 
value of a: 14 
value of a: 15

 The EXIT WHEN Statement The EXIT-WHEN statement allows the condition in the WHEN clause to be evaluated. If the condition is true, the loop completes and control passes to the statement immediately after the END LOOP. Following are the two important aspects for the EXIT WHEN statement − Until the condition is true, the EXIT-WHEN statement acts like a NULL statement, except for evaluating the condition, and does not terminate the loop. A statement inside the loop must change the value of the condition. Syntax The syntax for an EXIT WHEN statement in PL/SQL is as follows − 
EXIT WHEN condition;
 The EXIT WHEN statement replaces a conditional statement like if-then used with the EXIT statement. Example 
DECLARE 
   a number(2) := 10; 
BEGIN 
   -- while loop execution  
   WHILE a < 20 LOOP 
      dbms_output.put_line ('value of a: ' || a);  
      a := a + 1; 
      -- terminate the loop using the exit when statement 
   EXIT WHEN a > 15; 
   END LOOP; 
END;
