OrientDB database is not only a Document database but also a Graph database. New concepts such as Vertex and Edge are used to store the data in the form of graph. It applies polymorphism on vertices. The base class for Vertex is V. In this chapter you can learn how to create vertex to store graph data. The following statement is the basic syntax of Create Vertex Command. 
CREATE VERTEX [<class>] [CLUSTER <cluster>] [SET <field> = <expression>[,]*]
 Following are the details about the options in the above syntax. <class> − Defines the class to which the vertex belongs. <cluster> − Defines the cluster in which it stores the vertex. <field> − Defines the field you want to set. <expression> − Defines the express to set for the field. Example Try the following example to understand how to create vertex. Execute the following query to create a vertex without ‘name’ and on the base class V. 
orientdb> CREATE VERTEX
 If the above query is executed successfully, you will get the following output. 
Created vertex 'V#9:0 v1' in 0.118000 sec(s)
 Execute the following query to create a new vertex class named v1, then create vertex in that class. 
orientdb> CREATE CLASS V1 EXTENDS V 
orientdb> CREATE VERTEX V1
 If the above query is executed successfully, you will get the following output. 
Created vertex 'V1#14:0 v1' in 0.004000 sec(s)
 Execute the following query to create a new vertex of the class named v1, defining its properties such as brand = 'Maruti' and name = 'Swift'. 
orientdb> CREATE VERTEX V1 SET brand = 'maruti', name = 'swift'
 If the above query is executed successfully, you will get the following output. 
Created vertex 'V1#14:1{brand:maruti,name:swift} v1' in 0.004000 sec(s)
