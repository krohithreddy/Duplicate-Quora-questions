<condition> Tag is similar to switch statements in programming language. It helps ALICE to respond to the matching input. Syntax 
<condition name = "variable-name" value = "variable-value"/>
 For example, consider the following conversation. 
Human: How are you feeling today
Robot: I am happy!
 Here we've stored happy as the state of ALICE and that is how it responds as "I am happy!". Example Create condition.aiml inside C > ab > bots > test > aiml and condition.aiml.csv inside C > ab > bots > test > aimlif directories. condition.aiml 
<?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"?>
<aiml version = "1.0.1" encoding = "UTF-8"?>
   <category>
      <pattern> HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY </pattern>
      
      <template>
         <think><set name = "state"> happy</set></think>
         <condition name = "state" value = "happy">
            I am happy!
         </condition>
         
         <condition name = "state" value = "sad">
            I am sad!
         </condition>
      </template>
