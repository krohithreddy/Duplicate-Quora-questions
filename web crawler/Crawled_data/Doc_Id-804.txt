SQL Server data type is an attribute that specifies types of data of any object. Each column, variable and expression has related data type in SQL Server. These data types can be used while creating tables. You can choose a particular data type for a table column based on your requirement. SQL Server offers seven categories including other category of data types for use. Exact Numeric Types Type From To bigint -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 int -2,147,483,648 2,147,483,647 smallint -32,768 32,767 tinyint 0 255 bit 0 1 decimal -10^38 +1 10^38 –1 numeric -10^38 +1 10^38 –1 money -922,337,203,685,477.5808 +922,337,203,685,477.5807 smallmoney -214,748.3648 +214,748.3647 Numeric and decimal are Fixed precision and scale data types and are functionally equivalent. Approximate Numeric Types Type From To Float -1.79E + 308 1.79E + 308 Real -3.40E + 38 3.40E + 38 Date and Time Types Type From To datetime(3.33 milliseconds accuracy) Jan 1, 1753 Dec 31, 9999 smalldatetime(1 minute accuracy) Jan 1, 1900 Jun 6, 2079 date(1 day accuracy.

Other Data Types sql_variant − Stores values of various SQL Server-supported data types, except text, ntext, and timestamp. timestamp − Stores a database-wide unique number that gets updated every time a row gets updated. uniqueidentifier − Stores a globally unique identifier (GUID). xml − Stores XML data. You can store XML instances in a column or a variable (Introduced in SQL Server 2005). cursor − A reference to a cursor. table − Stores a result set for later processing. hierarchyid − A variable length, system data type used to represent position in a hierarchy (Introduced in SQL Server 2008).
