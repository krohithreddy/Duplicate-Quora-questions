A copy of an existing table can be created using a combination of the CREATE TABLE statement and the SELECT statement. The new table has the same column definitions. All columns or specific columns can be selected. When you will create a new table using the existing table, the new table would be populated using the existing values in the old table. Syntax The basic syntax for creating a table from another table is as follows − 
CREATE TABLE NEW_TABLE_NAME AS
   SELECT [ column1, column2...columnN ]
   FROM EXISTING_TABLE_NAME
   [ WHERE ]
 Here, column1, column2... are the fields of the existing table and the same would be used to create fields of the new table. Example Following is an example, which would create a table SALARY using the CUSTOMERS table and having the fields customer ID and customer SALARY − 
SQL> CREATE TABLE SALARY AS
   SELECT ID, SALARY
   FROM CUSTOMERS;
 This would create a new table SALARY which will have the following records − 
+----+----------+
| ID | SALARY   |
+----+----------+
|  1 |  2000.00 |
|  2 |  1500.00 |
|  3 |  2000.00 |
|  4 |  6500.00 |
|  5 |  8500.00 |
|  6 |  4500.00 |
|  7 | 10000.00 |
+----+----------+
